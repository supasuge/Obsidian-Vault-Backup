# Overview
**Welcome to GrizzCTF 2023**, the first of it's kind! Whether you've just started your hacker journey or you're just looking for some new challenges, you've came to the right place! The goal of these challenges is to learn different methods of problem solving, and to have fun most of all! If this is your first CTF, check out the `about` or `how to play` page. Or... `just get started now!`
**Flag Format**: `GrizzCTF{...................}`
- This will be the flag format across all challenges, be on lookout!
Note: `grep -i 'grizzctf{'` Should be of much help throughout the different challenges

## How to Play
If you've never experienced a CTF event before, don't get frustrated or give up, because the key to any type of skilled profession is practice, and patience along with intense determination.

GrizzCTF is split into 5 different categories structured in a jeopardy styled format featuring 5 challenges per category in 100 point increments (100-500). Each team will play through the challenges on there own, at the end of the 48 Hours; the team with the most points wins! If there is a tie, additional challenges will be added for a tie breaker!

There is a maximum number of 4 players per team, however you do not need to play with a team if you do not want to. You are more than welcome to play solo, however it is recommended to find a team to play with; as it can be hugely beneficial to have player's with different skillset's and thinking methodologies.

You  will often find the challenges quite ambiguous, however this is the point! Do not hesitate to use any resource you feel could be helpful towards finding a solution.
