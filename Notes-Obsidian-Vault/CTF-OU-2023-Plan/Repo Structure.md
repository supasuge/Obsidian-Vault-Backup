For the CTF, when the event begins players will be able to register accounts/login then will be given the option to either join a team, or create a team. Each team has 4 players max, although you are more than welcome to play alone if you wish. The CTF will last until the end of the hackathon, at which point the top 3 winning teams will be announced. (Or something like that)
