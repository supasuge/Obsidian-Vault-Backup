Reverse Engineering is the systematic approach to determine the inner workings of an application by inspecting the application's logic flow and responses to specific inputs. 

**Common RE activities**:
- Fuzzing
- Decompilation

- Debugging
	Allows you to perform dynamic analysis and set break points to stepo through the execution of a program. Another option would be to perform active analysis and step through the code with something like `GDB, or GEF`

# Reverse Engineering
These challenges are typically quite hard for beginner's. This checklist does not fully cover all things Reverse Engineering; as it's and extensive and difficult topic. However, the goal of this checklist is to give you a foundation to play with reverse engineering a bit and begin to start poking around and asking questions.
1. Whenever you get a file, issuing the `file` command is useful to know what the file really is
2. Use `strings <filename>` command to read the string in the binary to find some clues.
3. Strong knowledge of C, and Assembly Language  computer architecture is required for this category of challenges
