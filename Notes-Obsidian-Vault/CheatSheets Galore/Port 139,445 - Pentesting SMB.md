**Port 139**: *NetBIOS* Stands for Network Basic Input Output System. It's a software protocol that allows applications, pcs, desktops etc. to communicate on a LAN network to communicate with network hardware and to transmit data across the network. 
- Applications that run on NetBIOS name is up to 16 characters long
- Separate from the computer name.
```bash
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
```

Port 445[](#port-445)

While Port 139 is known technically as ‘NBT over IP’, Port 445 is ‘SMB over IP’. **SMB** stands for ‘**Server Message Blocks**’. Server Message Block in modern language is also known as **Common Internet File System**. The system operates as an application-layer network protocol primarily used for offering shared access to files, printers, serial ports, and other sorts of communications between nodes on a network.

For instance, on Windows, SMB can run directly over TCP/IP without the need for NetBIOS over TCP/IP. This will use, as you point out, port 445. On other systems, you’ll find services and applications using port 139. This means that SMB is running with NetBIOS over TCP/IP**.** (extracted from [here](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/smb-port-what-is-port-445-port-139-used-for))

#### 

IPC$ share[](#ipcusd-share)

From book _**Network Security Assessment 3rd edition**_

With an anonymous null session you can access the IPC$ share and interact with services exposed via named pipes. The enum4linux utility within Kali Linux is particularly useful; with it, you can obtain the following:

- Operating system information
    

- Details of the parent domain
    

- A list of local users and groups
    

- Details of available SMB shares
    

- The effective system security policy
