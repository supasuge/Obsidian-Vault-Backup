### .NET

There are a few ways to install `.NET`. Regardless of how or what platform you install `.NET` onto, you can validate your installation by running `dotnet --version` from a terminal window.

```powershell
C:\> dotnet --version

7.0.304
```

This command will output the version of .NET installed on your machine. If you see the version number of the version you installed, then the installation was successful.
