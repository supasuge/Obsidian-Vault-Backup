In order to configure a system startup service, it's important to first understand `systemd` and it's implications.
### Understanding systemd and Services

- **systemd** is the first process that gets started by the kernel and is assigned the process ID 1. It is responsible for bringing the Linux system into a usable state by starting services and other units.
- A **service** in the context of **systemd** is a unit that describes how to manage a software application or daemon. These units are defined in `.service` files.

### Configuring a Package to Run at Startup

1. **Identify or Create a Service File:**
    
    - If the package you installed does not come with a systemd service file, you may need to create one. Service files are typically located in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`.
    - A service file ends with the `.service` extension and configures how and when the service should start.
2. **Creating a Custom Service File (if necessary):**
    
    - Create a new file in `/etc/systemd/system/` named `your-service-name.service`.
    - Edit the file to define the service. Here is a basic template:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Your Service Description
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/path/to/your/application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```
