#### Using MegaPing

Another tool that can perform a ping sweep, as well as several other functions, is MegaPing. MegaPing is a GUI‚Äêbased tool that runs on Windows. It incorporates several functions into a single interface. The ping sweep can be accomplished using the IP Scanner tool, which you would select from the list on the left side. Figure 5.1 shows the full interface after running the IP scan. By default, the MAC address and hostnames are not included in the list. There are check boxes on the right side, however, that can be checked even after you have run a scan, and the information will be added.
