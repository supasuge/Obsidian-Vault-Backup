# HTTP Basics (RFC 2616)
#### Request Methods
- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST**: Send data to a server to create/update a resource.
- **PUT**: Replace all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- **DELETE**: Remove specified resource.
- **HEAD**: Same as GET but without response body.
- **OPTIONS**: Describe the communication options for the target resource.

#### Status Codes
- **1xx (Informational)**: Request received, continuing process.
- **2xx (Successful)**: The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
- **4xx (Client Error)**: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
- **5xx (Server Error)**: The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.

#### Headers
- **General Headers**: Apply to both request and response messages (e.g., `Cache-Control`, `Date`).
- **Request Headers**: Include more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself (e.g., `Host`, `User-Agent`).
- **Response Headers**: Give additional information about the server's response (e.g., `Server`, `Set-Cookie`).
- **Entity Headers**: Contain information about the body of the resource (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`).

#### Secure Communication
- **HTTPS**: Use of SSL/TLS to encrypt HTTP requests and responses.
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: Enforce secure (HTTPS) connections to the server.

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Basic Authentication**: Credentials sent as user ID/password pairs, encoded using Base64.
- **Bearer Tokens**: Typically used with OAuth, where the token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

#### Common Vulnerabilities
- **Session Hijacking**: Exploiting a valid computer session to gain unauthorized access to information or services.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Unauthorized commands transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injection of malicious scripts into content from otherwise trusted websites.
