	- These framework's etc. will have various commonalities among them(Cookies, headers)

- HTTP headers
- Cookies
- HTML source code
- Specific files and folders
- File extensions
- Error messages
- `X-Powered-By` - indicates the web application framework (can be disabled)

##### Tools
```bash
nc -nv {ip} {port}   # Grab headers
```

### Specific Files and Folders

There is another approach which greatly helps an attacker or tester to identify applications or components with high accuracy. Every web application component has its specific file and folder structure on the server. It has been noted that one can see the specific path from the HTML page source but sometimes they are not explicitly presented there and may still reside on the server.

In order to uncover them, a technique known as forced browsing or “dirbusting” is used. Dirbusting is brute forcing a target with known folder and filenames and monitoring HTTP-responses to enumerate server content. This information can be used both for finding default files and attacking them, and for fingerprinting the web application. Dirbusting can be done in several ways, the example below shows a successful dirbusting attack against a WordPress-powered target with the help of defined list and intruder functionality of Burp Suite.

We can see that for some WordPress-specific folders (for instance, `/wp-includes/`, `/wp-admin/` and `/wp-content/`) HTTP responses are 403 (Forbidden), 302 (Found, redirection to `wp-login.php`), and 200 (OK) respectively. This is a good indicator that the target is WordPress powered. The same way it is possible to dirbust different application plugin folders and their versions. In the screenshot below one can see a typical CHANGELOG file of a Drupal plugin, which provides information on the application being used and discloses a vulnerable plugin version.
