## Recursive Fuzzing
Fuzzing large amounts of directories takes forever. `recursive fuzzing` is good in this situation.


### Recursive Flags
When recursive scanning, it automatically starts another scan under any newly identified directories that may have on their pages until it has fuzzed the main website and all of it's subdirectories.

Some website's may have a big tree of sub-directoreis like: `/login/user/content/uploads/...etc`
This will expand the scanning tree and may take a ==long time==

This is why it's akways advised to specify a depth to our recursive scan, such that it will not scan directories that are deeper than specified depth.

### Recursion Options
#ffuf #tools #fuzzing #recursivefuzzing
###### Flags
```bash
ffuf [ ] ->
-recursion
-recursion-depth {} : specify recursion depth

If -recursion-depth 1, it will only fuzz the main directories and their direct sub-directories. If any sub-sub-directories are identified (like /login/user, it will not fuzz them for pages). When using recursion in ffuf, we can specify our extension with -e .php


```
#### Recursive Scanning In action
Let us repeat the first command we used, add the recursion flags to it while specifying `.php` as our extension, and see what results we get:
```bash
ffuf -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://SERVER_IP:PORT/FUZZ -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v
```

#### Question
	Try to repeat what you learned so far to find more files/directories. one of them should give you a flag what is the content of the flag?
```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://94.237.54.59:41786/FUZZ' -recursion -recursion-depth 1 -e .php -v -ic
