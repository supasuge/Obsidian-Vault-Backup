#ffuf #valuefuzzing
After fuzzing a working parameter, we now have to fuzz the correct value that would return the flag content we need. 

This section will discuss fuzzing for parameter values, which should be fairly similar to fuzzing for parameters, once we develop our wordlist


### Custom Wordlists
- May not always find custom wordlists of value for current test
- For usernames, pre-made wordlists are available or create ur own based on users that may be using the website
- May need custom parameters such as `id` that can accept a number input of some sort. These ids cna be in a custom format, or can be sequential, like from `1-1000` or `1-1000000` etc.

##### Writing 1-1000 to a file bash 1 liner
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 1000); do echo $i >> id.txt; done

$ ls
id.txt
```
#### Value Fuzzing
Should be similar to the POST command we used to FUZZ for parameters, but out FUZZ keyword should be put where the parameter value woudl be, and we will use the id.txt wordlist as created as folllows:
```bash
ffuf -w id.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:PORT/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs xxx
```
