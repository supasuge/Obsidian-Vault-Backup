# FFuF VHosts Fuzzing Cheat Sheet

FFuF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) can be utilized to perform VHosts fuzzing to identify both public and non-public sub-domains and VHosts on a known IP. Hereâ€™s how to use FFuF for VHosts fuzzing:

## Basic Usage
- **`ffuf -w <wordlist> -u http://<IP>/ -H "Host: FUZZ"`**: This is the basic format for VHost fuzzing. Replace `<wordlist>` with your wordlist file and `<IP>` with the target IP address.

## Custom Headers
- **`-H "Host: FUZZ.example.com"`**: Fuzz with a specific domain in the host header. Replace `example.com` with the target domain.

## Filtering Results
- **`-fs <size>`**: Filter out responses of specific sizes (in bytes).
- **`-fc <code>`**: Exclude responses with certain HTTP status codes.

## Advanced Usage
- **`-e <suffix>`**: Add a suffix to each payload. Useful for adding domain endings.
- **`-mr <regex>`**: Match responses with specific regex patterns.
- **`-fw <words>`**: Filter by word count in the response.

## Parallelization and Performance
- **`-t <threads>`**: Set the number of concurrent HTTP requests. Higher numbers increase speed.

## Output and Reporting
- **`-o <filename>`**: Output results to a file.
- **`-of csv`**: Output format, e.g., CSV for easy analysis.

## Examples
- **Basic VHost Fuzzing**: `ffuf -w subdomains.txt -u http://192.168.1.1/ -H "Host: FUZZ"`
- **With Domain Specified**: `ffuf -w vhosts_wordlist -u http://target-ip/ -H "Host: FUZZ.targetdomain.com"`

Remember, VHosts fuzzing with FFuF requires a good wordlist tailored to the target. Always ensure legal and ethical use of fuzzing tools in your security assessments.
