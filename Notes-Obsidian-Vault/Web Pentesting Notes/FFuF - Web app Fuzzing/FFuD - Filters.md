### Matching
```bash
-mc: Match HTTP status codes 'all' for all
-ml: match # of lines
-mr: match regexp
-ms: Match HTTP response size
-mw: Match amount of words in response
```
### Filters
```bash
-fc: Filter HTTP status Code
-fl: Filter # of lines
-fr: Filter regexp
-fs: Filter HTTP response size
-fw: Filter by amount of words in response
```

## 1. Status Code Filters
Filters based on HTTP status codes
- **Include specific code:** `-mc 200`
	- only responses with a 200 OK status.
- `-fc 404` Excludes all 404 Not Found responses
- `-ms 512` Includes responses exactly 512 bytes in size.
- `-fs 512` Excludes responses 512 bytes in size

# FFuF Filters Cheat Sheet

FFuF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a web fuzzing tool with various filters to control and optimize the fuzzing process. Below are some of the common filters used in FFuF:

## Size Filters
- **`-fs <size>`**: Filter by response size. Exclude responses of a specific size (in bytes).
- **`-fl <lines>`**: Filter by line count. Ignore responses with a specific number of lines.

## Status Code Filters
- **`-fc <code>`**: Filter by HTTP status code. Skip responses with certain status codes.
- **`-mc <code>`**: Match only specific HTTP status codes.

## Word Count Filters
- **`-fw <words>`**: Filter by word count. Dismiss responses with a certain number of words.
- **`-mw <words>`**: Match responses with a specific number of words.

## Regex Filters
- **`-fr <regex>`**: Filter with regular expressions. Exclude responses matching the given regex pattern.
- **`-mr <regex>`**: Match responses with a specific regex pattern.

## Time Filters
- **`-ft <time>`**: Filter by response time. Ignore responses taking longer or shorter than a specified time to respond (in milliseconds).

## Custom Filters
- **`-custom <module>`**: Use custom Python modules for advanced filtering.

## Other Useful Options
- **`-sa`**: Stop on all responses. Useful for quickly identifying anomalies.
- **`-se`**: Stop on errors. Cease fuzzing when an error is encountered.

Remember to combine these filters wisely based on the specific requirements of your fuzzing task. FFuF offers flexibility and efficiency, making it a valuable tool in web security assessments.
