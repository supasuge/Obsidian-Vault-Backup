Basic Authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it doesn't require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather HTTP Basic Auth uses standard fields in the HTTP header.


The BA mechanism provides **no confidentiality protection** for the transmitted credentials. They are merely **encoded with Base64** in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way. HTTPS is, therefore, typically preferred used in conjunction with Basic Authentication.
