Creating burp proxy
Before attempting to install Burp's CA certificate, make sure that you have successfully [confirmed that the proxy listener is active](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config/check-listener) and have [configured your browser to work with Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config)

#### Note

These steps are only necessary if you want to use your own external browser for manual testing with Burp. If you prefer, you can just use [Burp's browser](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/burps-browser), which is preconfigured to work with Burp Proxy already. To access Burp's browser, go to the **Proxy > Intercept** tab, and click **Open Browser**.

#### Note

If you previously installed a different CA certificate generated by Burp, you should [remove it](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config/certificate/ca-cert-firefox#removing-burp-s-ca-certificate-from-firefox) before installing a new one.

To install Burp's CA certificate in Firefox, proceed as follows:

With Burp running, visit `http://burpsuite` in Firefox. You should be taken to a page that says "Welcome to [Burp Suite Professional](https://portswigger.net/burp/pro)". If not, please refer to the [proxy troubleshooting](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/external-browser-config/certificate/proxy-troubleshooting) page. Depending on what went wrong, you may be taken there automatically.

In the top-right corner of the page, click **CA Certificate** to download your unique Burp CA certificate. Take note of where you save this.

In Firefox, open the burger menu and click **Preferences** or **Options**.

From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, open the **Privacy and Security** settings.

Scroll down to the **Certificates** section and click the **View certificates** button.

When prompted to edit the trust settings, make sure the checkbox **This certificate can identify websites** is selected and click **OK**.

Close and restart Firefox. With Burp still running, try and browse to any HTTPS URL. If everything has worked, you should now be able to browse to the page without any security warnings.
