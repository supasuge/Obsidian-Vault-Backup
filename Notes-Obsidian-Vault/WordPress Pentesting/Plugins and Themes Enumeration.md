#### Plugins Active Enumeration
```shell
$ curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:08:23 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Location: http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/
Content-Length: 356
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

If the content does not exist, we will receive a `404 Not Found error`.

```shell
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/someplugin
```

To speed up enumeration, we could also write a simple bash script or use a tool such as `wfuzz` or `WPScan`, which automate the process.


# Directory Indexing
Active plugins should not be our only area of focus when assessing a WordPress website. Even if a plugin is deactivated, it may still be accessible, and therefore we can gain access to its associated scripts and functions. Deactivating a vulnerable plugin does not improve the WordPress's sites security. It is best practice to either remove or keep up-to-date any unused plugins. 

The following example shows a disabled plugin.

If we browse to the plugins directory, we can see that we still have access to the `Mail Masta` plugin.

We can also view the directory listing using cURL and convert the HTML output to a nice readable format using `html2text`.

Directory Indexing

```shell
