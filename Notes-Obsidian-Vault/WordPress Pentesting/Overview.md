## What is Wordpress?

WordPress is the most popular Content Management System (CMS), powering almost one-third of all websites in the world. It can be used for multiple purposes, such as hosting blogs, forums, e-commerce, project management, document management, and more.


- It has a large library of extensions called themes and plugins, both free and paid, that can be added to enhance the website. Some examples of plugins are *WPForms*, a robust contact form, *MonsterInsights* that interfaces with Google Analytics, and *Constant Contact* a popular email marketing service


It customizability and extensible nature make it prone to vulnerabilities through third-party themes and plugins.

Wordpress is written in PHP and usually runs on apache with MySQL backend. Many hosting companies offer WordPress as an option when creating a new website and even assist with backend tasks such as security updates.

## What is a CMS?

A CMS is a powerful tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch (or even know how to write code at all). The CMS does most of the "heavy lifting" on the infrastructure side to focus more on the design and presentation aspects of the website instead of the backend structure



Most CMS' provide a rich [What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor where users can edit content as if they were working in a word processing tool such as Microsoft Word. Users can upload media directly from a media library interface instead of interacting with the webserver either from a management portal or via FTP or SFTP.

A CMS is made up of two key components:

- A **Content Management Application** (CMA) - the interface used to add and manage content.
- A **Content Delivery Application** (CDA) - the backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working, visually appealing websi


## WordPress Site Structure
### Default Wordpress file structure
WordPress can be installed on a Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX host. For this module, we will focus on a default WordPress installation on an Ubuntu Linux web server. WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host. After installation, all WordPress supporting files and directories will be accessible in the webroot located at `/var/www/html`

#### File Structure

```shell
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html
.
├── index.php
├── license.txt
├── readme.html
├── wp-activate.php
├── wp-admin
├── wp-blog-header.php
├── wp-comments-post.php
├── wp-config.php
├── wp-config-sample.php
├── wp-content
├── wp-cron.php
├── wp-includes
├── wp-links-opml.php
├── wp-load.php
├── wp-login.php
├── wp-mail.php
├── wp-settings.php
├── wp-signup.php
├── wp-trackback.php
└── xmlrpc.php
```


## Key WordPress Files

The root directory of WordPress contains files that are needed to configure WordPress to function correctly.

- `index.php` is the homepage of WordPress.
    
- `license.txt` contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.
    
- `wp-activate.php` is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.
    
- `wp-admin` folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page can be located at one of the following paths:
    
    - `/wp-admin/login.php`
    - `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`
    - `/login.php`
    - `/wp-login.php`

This file can also be renamed to make it more challenging to find the login page.

- `xmlrpc.php` is a file representing a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication has been replaced by the WordPress [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference).


## WordPress Configuration File

- The `wp-config.php` file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database, such as the database name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix. This configuration file can also be used to activate DEBUG mode, which can useful in troubleshooting.

#### wp-config.php

```php
<?php
/** <SNIP> */
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'database_name_here' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'username_here' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );

/** Authentication Unique Keys and Salts */
/* <SNIP> */
define( 'AUTH_KEY',         'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_KEY',    'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_KEY',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'AUTH_SALT',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_SALT', 'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_SALT',   'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_SALT',       'put your unique phrase here' );

/** WordPress Database Table prefix */
$table_prefix = 'wp_';

/** For developers: WordPress debugging mode. */
/** <SNIP> */
define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );

/** Absolute path to the WordPress directory. */
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
	define( 'ABSPATH', __DIR__ . '/' );
}

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php';
```


### Key WordPress Directories
- The `wp-content` folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored. The subdirectory `uploads/` is usually where any files uploadeds to the platform are stored. These directories and files should be carefully enumerated as they may lead to contain sensitive data that could lead to remote code execution or exploitation of other vulnerabilities/misconfigurations


#### WP-Content

```shell
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-content
.
├── index.php
├── plugins
└── themes
```

- `wp-includes` contains everything except for the administrative components and the themes that belong to the website. This is the directory where core files are stored, such as certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets

#### WP-Includes

```shell
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-includes
.
├── <SNIP>
├── theme.php
├── update.php
├── user.php
├── vars.php
├── version.php
├── widgets
├── widgets.php
├── wlwmanifest.xml
├── wp-db.php
└── wp-diff.php
```


# WordPress User Roles

---

There are five types of users in a standard WordPress installation.

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|Administrator|This user has access to administrative features within the website. This includes adding and deleting users and posts, as well as editing source code.|
|Editor|An editor can publish and manage posts, including the posts of other users.|
|Author|Authors can publish and manage their own posts.|
|Contributor|These users can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.|
|Subscriber|These are normal users who can browse posts and edit their profiles.|
