**Binary Exploitation**
- Format String
- Heap Exploitation
- Stack Exploitation

Occurs when a program receives data that is longer then expected, such that it overwrites the entire bugger memory space on the stack.
- Can overwrite the next instruction pointer *EIP or RIP(in x86_64)*
	- Causes program to crash because it will attempt to execute instructions at an invalid memory address. 
	- Another basic attack is to overwrite a value on the stack to change the program's behavior.

With more advanced memory protections, it may not be possible to load our entire shellcode and point to it. Instead, we may use a combination of instructions from the binary to execute a particular function and overwrite various pointers to change the program execution flow. This is known as Return Oriented Programming (`ROP`) attacks.


- Some programs and operating systems may use the Heap instead of the Stack to store buffer memory, which would require Heap Overflows or heap Exploitation methods.



# Stack overflow
Tack has a list in first out (LIFO) design. Only one can pop out the last element or pushed into the stacl.

The following table demonstrates how the stack works. We can click on `push` to push a value from `eax` to the stack, and `pop` to pop the top value from the stack into `eax`:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|||
|||
|||
|0xabcdef|<-- Top of Stack (`$esp`)|
|0x12345678|<-- Bottom of Stack (`$ebp`)|


EIP (End Instruction Pointer) - Return Address
EBP - Bottom of the stack pointer

# Stack Overflow Protections
- Modern OSs have protections such as preventing code execution or randomly changing the memory addresses. 

- Many Bypasses exist, such as *ROP* chains or windows exploits like Egg Hinting or Structured Exception Handling (SEH) exploitation
modern compilers prevent the usage of functions that are vulnerable to Stack overflows,
