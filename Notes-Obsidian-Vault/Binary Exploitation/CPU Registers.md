The CPU is the brain of the computer. It's responsible for executing instructions. These instructions are simplistic, and at binary level. CPU has many areas where it can store and modify data, these are called `registers`

```asm
mov eax, 5
mov ebx, 4
add eax, ebx
```
1. `mov` moves the value of 5 into the register `eax`.
2. `mov` moves the value of 4 into the register `ebx`.
3. `add` instruction add the value of 4(`eax`) into -> `ebx`


#### Add 1, subtract 1
```assembly
function subtract(input):
    mov eax, input
    sub eax, 1
    mov output, eax

function add(input):
	mov eax, input
	add eax, 1
	mov output, eax
	
cmp operation, '-'
je subtract_number:
	subtract(number)
	exit

```

Instructions are represented as numbers, like all other data on a computer. These numbers are known as operation codes, often shortened to `opcodes`. These opcodes vary depending on the CPU architecture. The CPU Knows each opcode and what it needs to do when encountering each one. Opcodes are commonly represented in hexadecimal format. 
Ex:
If an `Intel` CPU encounters *0xE9* it knows that it needs to execute a `jmp` (jump) instruction.
