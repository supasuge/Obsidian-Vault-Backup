To see what breakpoints we have at any point of execution:
```bash
gef> info breakpoint
```


### Examine
	examining
- Evaluating values in the registers and addresses


`GEF` automates many steps that we usually take at a breakpoint. i.e, registers, the stack, and the current assembly instructions.

> To examine any of the addresses use the `x` command in the format of:
```bash
x:/FMT ADDRESS
```
- `ADDRESS` is the register or address to examine. 
- `FMT` is the examine format.
```bash
count - number of time to repeat the examie: Ex: 2,3,10

format - format we want to be represented in: Ex: x(hex), s(string), i(instruction)

size - The size of the memory we want to examine: b(byte), h(halfword), w(word), g(giant, 8 bytes)
```

#### Instructions
`$rip` hold the address of the next instructions.

use `4` for the `count`, `i` for the `format`, and `g` for the `size` (for 8-bytes or 64-bits). So, the final examine command would be `x/4ig $rip`, as follows:

  Instructions

```shell-session
gef➤  x/4ig $rip
```


#### Strings
- Can examine a variable stored at a specific memory address. We know that `message` variable is stored in the `.data` section on address `0x402000` from our previous disassembky. we also see the upcoming command `movabs`, `rsi`, `0x402000`, so..... We may want to examine what is being move from `0x402000`
- in this case, we will not put anything for the `count`, as we only want one address (1 is default) and will use `s` as the format.

```shell-session
gef➤  x/s 0x402000

0x402000:	"Hello HTB Academy!"
```
`Note: if we don't specify the `Size` or `Format`, it will default to the last one we used.`


### Addresses
Most common format of examining is *hex* `x`.
- All addresses and registers contain *hex* data.
Let us examine the same previous instruction, but in `hex` format, to see how it looks:

  Addresses

```shell-session
gef➤  x/wx 0x401000

0x401000 <_start>:	0x000001b8
```
