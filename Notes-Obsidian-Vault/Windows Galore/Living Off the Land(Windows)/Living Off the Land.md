Sysinternals Live

One of the great features of Windows Sysinternals is that there is no installation required. Microsoft provides a Windows Sysinternals service, Sysinternals live, with various ways to use and execute the tools. We can access and use them through:

- Web browser ([link](https://live.sysinternals.com/)).
- Windows Share
- Command prompt
In order to use these tools, you either download them or by entering the Sysinternal Live path \\live.sysinternals.com\tools into Windows Explorer.
