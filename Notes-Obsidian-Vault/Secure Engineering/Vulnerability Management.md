The NIST CSF comprises guidelines, standards, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk. In recent years, it gained immense popularity, and many organisations now employ the CSF to govern their cybersecurity state. Even though the NIST CSF has a broader range of applications, let's examine how to exploit its fundamental elements for vulnerability management.

  

## Identify

The framework's first and foremost objective is to provide a solid basis for a cybersecurity program. This stage addresses the query, "**What assets require protection?**" in the context of vulnerability management. This phase may involve the following steps:

- **Develop asset discovery methodologies**: You cannot safeguard what you do not know. Implement the required tools and procedures to achieve complete insight over enterprise assets, including those on-premises and cloud assets.
- **Discover assets in real-time:** The process of discovering assets should be automated to get a near real-time picture of all the assets within the organisation.
- **Ascertain the criticality of assets:** Adding security and business relevance to the assets would assist you in prioritising their significance to your business. It's crucial to analyse as much data as possible. Unfortunately, most companies use a subjective method to estimate the importance of their assets to the business. They tend to make cybersecurity decisions based on intuition rather than data, which yields poor results.



## Protect

This phase encompasses limiting or reducing the effects of a potential cyber incident and deploying the appropriate safeguards to secure the provision of IT infrastructure services. For vulnerability management, this phase addresses the query, "**Have you adopted the necessary measures to secure the assets of your organisation?**" This phase may involve the following steps:

- **Deploy security safeguards**: Make use of security systems and technology, and follow best practices, including proactive security (email security, network security, ransomware and anti-malware protection), preventative security (encryption, regular backups) and Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) (patch management solutions, Identity Access Management (IAM), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)).
- Deploy vulnerability management software.



## Detect

This phase outlines the operations performed to promptly recognise a cybersecurity incident's presence. To vulnerability management, this stage addresses the query, "**Have you put in place suitable measures to discover security vulnerabilities?**" This phase may involve the following steps:

- **Detect vulnerabilities**: After you have mapped the attack surface, you must implement tools and methods to detect vulnerabilities and shortcomings in the IT infrastructure. Discovering vulnerabilities is a crucial part of a program for managing vulnerabilities.
- **Prioritise vulnerabilities**: Since every enterprise has a large number of vulnerabilities, it is essential to prioritise vulnerabilities for remediation, ensuring that the responsible team takes adequate measures to fix vulnerabilities based on their priority.
- **Quantify risks:** Once vulnerabilities are prioritised, the associated risks can be quantified by assigning a score to each vulnerability, which can be customised based on the organisation's mission. Estimating cyber risk in quantified terms gives a consistent vocabulary for prioritising initiatives and tracking the efficacy of the overall cybersecurity program.
- **Monitor constantly**: Implement tools for continuous monitoring to detect newly found vulnerabilities, new assets, and other changes in your environment.



### Respond

This stage emphasizes the steps required once a cybersecurity vulnerability has been identified. This process addresses the query: "**Have you implemented the necessary techniques and mechanisms to mitigate the vulnerability's impact?**" This phase may involve the following steps:

- **Define ownership**: It is essential to determine who is responsible for addressing each vulnerability. Clarity regarding ownership warrants accountability and encourages action.
- **Establish reporting**: Reports present relevant stakeholders with the extent of vulnerabilities that have been identified. Creating risk-owner-specific reports enables progress comparisons. Leaderboards, warnings, and reminders can be utilised to encourage the concerned team member to fulfil their responsibilities for the assigned duties.
- **Share status regularly**: Provide stakeholders with timely updates on the remedial queue. A further part of status sharing is the ability to provide reports that demonstrate progress on risk mitigation and the commercial value the security program is bringing.
- **Adopt a risk acceptance approach**: Swiftly eliminating all discovered vulnerabilities is impossible. There could be circumstances where business-critical assets must be taken offline to address a vulnerability. One should establish a strategy for risk acceptance based on risk threshold and business requirements.
- **Establish remedial measures**: During normal operations, security teams should concentrate on eradicating large quantities of critical vulnerabilities and eliminating security holes swiftly and effectively. However, when adversaries actively exploit a newly discovered critical vulnerability, the security team should focus on finding and releasing patches or swift mitigations to address these severe vulnerabilities.



## Recover

This is the final step of the NIST CSF. This phase entails updating and strengthening resilience plans and restoring any compromised capabilities or services caused by a cybersecurity event. For vulnerability management, it addresses the query, "**Have you implemented the processes and technologies necessary for detecting and resolving future vulnerabilities?**" This phase may involve the following steps:

- **Implement sophisticated search capabilities**: Having the power to look for affected assets is one of the preventive measures required for vulnerability management remediation. In the detect stage, you must be able to quickly and precisely identify all compromised assets. Similarly, you should be able to confirm that vulnerability occurrences have been addressed during the Recover phase.
- **Extend security to unmanaged areas**: The expanding use of cloud infrastructure fuels the explosion of attack surfaces within organisations. In the recovery stage, it may be required to increase insight across conventional assets (e.g. laptops, desktops) and assets not currently covered by your solutions (e.g. IoT devices, cloud assets). A Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM) solution can fill this void and offer your organisation an accurate and almost real-time picture of its assets.  
- **Record lessons**: Revise your procedures to take account of the learnings from security events and improve the current cybersecurity strategy.
