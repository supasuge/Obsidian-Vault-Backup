- **What problems does redundancy cause?**
>
    Redundant data yields a higher frequency of data errors and inconsistencies, which in turn leads to poorer decision making. For example, if you entered “Tri-Lakes Realtors” and “Tri Lakes Realtors” on separate rows in the ClientName column, you would be unsure about the correct version of this client’s name. Summarized data about this client would not be complete or correct given the client would be misinterpreted as two different companies because of the two different spellings.
>    
    When you need to change data, redundancy also makes your changes more cumbersome and time-consuming. For example, to change a client’s name, you would need to update it in each row where it appears. Even if you use a global find-and-replace feature, multiple changes require more editing time than updating the client name in one location.  
>    Finally, while storage space is relatively inexpensive, redundancy wastes space because you’re storing the same data in multiple places. This extra space results in larger spreadsheets that require more space in memory and storage. Larger-than-necessary files also take longer to save and open.
