[DHCP RFC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2131)

 DHCP supports three mechanisms for IP address allocation.  In
   "automatic allocation", DHCP assigns a permanent IP address to a
   client.  In "dynamic allocation", DHCP assigns an IP address to a
   client for a limited period of time (or until the client explicitly
   relinquishes the address).
