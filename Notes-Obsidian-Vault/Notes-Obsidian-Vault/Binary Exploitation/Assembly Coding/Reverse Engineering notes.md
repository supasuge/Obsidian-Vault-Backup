Hexadecimal is similar to every other number system except in hexadecimal, each column has a value of 16 times the value of the column to its right. The fun part about hexadecimal is that not only do we have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 we have A, B, C, D, E and F and therefore 16 different symbols.

Lets look at a simple table to see how hexadecimal compares to decimal.

Decimal: Base 10
Hex: Base 16
Binary: Base 2
we can create a simple formula where b represents the base. In this case, b = 10.
($2 * b ^ 0) + (4 * b ^ 1)$
$(2 * 10 ^ 0) + (4 * 10 ^ 1) = 42$
$0 x 2 ^ 0 = 0$
$1 x 2 ^ 1 = 2$
$0 x 2 ^ 2 = 0$
$1 x 2 ^ 3 = 8$
$0 x 2 ^ 4 = 0$
$1 x 2 ^ 5 = 32$
$0 x 2 ^ 6 = 0$
$0 x 2 ^ 7 = 0$
$0 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 0 = 42$ (decimal)
