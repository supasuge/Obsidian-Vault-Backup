- To compile ARMv8 as ARMv8 on a non-ARMv8 Machine, we need to download the following:
`sudo apt install binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu aarch64-linux-gcc`

the resources above will assist in finding the correct command/flags.

```bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-gs -o chall.o chall.S
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o chall chall.o

```
After running file we can see that is is ARM `aarch64`. Howeverm x86_64 systems cannot run this code so we need to emulate it. We can install a version of QEMU that runs statically in the background with `sudo apt install qemu-user-static`. This is just so we can run ARM binaries like normal programs.

```bash
./chall1 4134207980 950176538
Result: 4134207980
