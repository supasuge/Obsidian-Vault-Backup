- Stack: LIFO design.
	- Fixed in size
	- Data can only be accessed in a specific order by push-ing and pop-ing data.
- Heap: Much larger and more versatile in storing data
- Data: Hold variables and `.bss` which is usd to hold unassigned variables
- Text: Main assembly instructions are loaded into the segment to be fetch and executed by the CPU.


### Instruction Set Architectures

*Instructions*: The instruction to be processed in the opcode `operand_list` format. There are usually 1,2,3 comma-separated operands.
	EX: `add rax, 1, mov rsp, rax, push rax`
*Registers*: Used to store operands, addresses or instructions temporarily
*Memory Addresses*: The address i which data or instructions are sotred may pair to memory or registers
The type of stored data.
## Registers, Addresses and Data Types
###### Registers
Data registers: Usually for storing instructions/syscall arguments. 
- `rax`
- `rbx`
- `rcx`
- `rdx`
- `r8`
- `r9`
- `r10`
Pointer Registers: Used to store specific important address pointers. Main pointer registers are the base stack pointer `rbp`
- `rbp`
- `rsp`
- `rip`
Sub-Registers: Each 64-bit register can be further divided into smaller sub-registers containing the lower bits, at one byte `8-bits`, `2 bytes 16-bits`, and `4 bytes 32-bits`.
