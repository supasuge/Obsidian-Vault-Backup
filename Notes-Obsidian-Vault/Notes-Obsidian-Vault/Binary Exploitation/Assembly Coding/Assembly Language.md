- Can write direct instructions the processors understand.

###### Example
`add rax, 1` is easier then its equivalent machine shellcode '`4883C001`', and much easier to remember Â than the equivalent binary machine code '`01001000 10000011 11000000 00000001`


**Machine Code is often represented as `ShellCode`, a Hex Representation of machine code bytes.**

Shellcode can be translated back to its assembly counterpart and can also be loaded directly into memory as binary instructions to be executed.

## High-Level Vs. Low-Level
There are different processor designs, each processor understands a different set of machine instructions and a different `Asssembly Format`
- In the early 1970's, high-level languages likes `C` were developed to make it possible to write a single easy to understand code that can work on any processor without rewriting it for each processor. This was was made possible by creating compilers for each language. 

- When `High-Level` Code is translated into assembly instructions for the processor it is being compiled for, which is then assembled into machine doe to run on the processor. This is why compilers are build for various languages and various processors to convert the high-level code into assembly code and then machine code that matches the running processor.

### Compilation Stages
![[Pasted image 20231202001627.png]]

```python
print("hello world!")
```

```C
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
	write(1, "Hello world!", 12);
	_exit(0);
}
```
The above code ueese the Linux `write` syscall, built-in for processes to write to the screen. The same syscall called in Assembly looks like the folliwing:
```
mor rax, 1
mov rdi, 1
mod rsi, message
mov rda, 12
syscall

mov rax, 60
mov rdi, 0
syscall
```
- The `write` syscall is called in `C` or Assembly. Both are using the ` 1 ` , teh test, adn 12 as the arguments. 
	- Assembly Code, Shellcode and binary machine code are modtly identical but writtent in different formats.
- Value of Knowing Assembly for pentesters: 
	- Binary overflows
	- ROP Chains
	- Heap Exploitation
	- etc.
	- Will likely need to use some sort of assembly at some point

In the above 'Hello World' example, which Assembly instruction will '00001111 00000101' execute?
