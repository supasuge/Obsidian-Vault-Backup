1. Get piebase address
2. Leak stack canary address
3. Perform Ret2Win

PIE fi enabled will randomized. Need to leak it to get the offset of the addresses.

To leak piebase, fuzz for values on the stack which has a constant value. Before that, you need to disable `ASLR ( Address Space Layout Randomization )` because it works with `PIE` to randomize addresses
