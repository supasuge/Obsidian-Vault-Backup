	XSS That is stored in the database persistently and executed on any user that visits the page.

As we can see, the first row shows that our request was a `GET` request. `GET` request sends their parameters and data as part of the URL. So, `to target a user, we can send them a URL containing our payload`. To get the URL, we can copy the URL from the URL bar in Firefox after sending our XSS payload, or we can right-click on the `GET` request in the `Network` tab and select `Copy>Copy URL`. Once the victim visits this URL, the XSS payload would execute:
