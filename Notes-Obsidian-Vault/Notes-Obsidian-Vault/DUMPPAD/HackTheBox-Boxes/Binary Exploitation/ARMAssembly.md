The following resources are useful to learn about how ARM assembly works:

- [ARM Instruction Set Tutorial](https://azeria-labs.com/arm-instruction-set-part-3/)
    

- [Arm Architecture Reference Manual](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/latest)


**To COmpile ARMv8 as ARMv8 on a non-ARMv8 machine, need a cross compiler. GNU project has a suite of cross compiler tools that can be used for ARMv8. To install on Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt install binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

**Run the following commands to cross compile the challenge ARM Assenbly**
```assembly
aarch64-linux-gnu-as -o chall.o chall.S
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o chall chall.o
```
Not that we have the binary can use file to see that it is compiled for ARM aarch64. However x86_64 systems cannot run this code, Need QEMU:

To install QEMU:**
```bash
sudo apt install qemu-user-static
```
