## Diffie-Hellman
Set of integers $mod(n)$, with operations of both addition and multiplication is a **Ring**. I.e., adding or multiplying any two elements in the set returns the element in the set.

- when modulus is prime `n=p`, we are guaranteed an inverse of every element in the set. Therefore the ring is promoted to a field
