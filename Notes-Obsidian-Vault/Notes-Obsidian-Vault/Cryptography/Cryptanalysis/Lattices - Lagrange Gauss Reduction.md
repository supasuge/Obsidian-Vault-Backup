### Understanding the Basics

1. **Lattice in Mathematics**: In mathematics, a lattice is a discrete set of points in n-dimensional space with a periodic structure. Think of it as a grid extending infinitely in all directions.
    
2. **Basis of a Lattice**: A basis of a lattice is a set of vectors that, when combined with integer coefficients, can produce every point in the lattice. For a two-dimensional lattice, two vectors are sufficient to form a basis.
    
3. **Lattice Reduction**: This is the process of finding a 'nicer' basis for a lattice. 'Nicer' often means that the basis vectors are shorter and more orthogonal (i.e., closer to being at right angles to each other).
    

### The Algorithm
#### Steps:
1. **Input**: Two vectors `u` and `v` forming a basis of a lattice. Ensure `||v|| <= ||u||`, else swap them.
    
2. **Iterative Process**:
    - Compute an integer `q` which is the nearest integer to the dot product of `u` and `v/||v||^2`.
    - Update `r` as `u - q*v`.
    - Swap `u` and `v`, and then set `v` to `r`.

1. **Output**: A reduced basis `(u, v)` for the lattice.

##### Python Code Example
```python
import numpy as np

def lagrange_gauss_reduction(u, v):
    while np.linalg.norm(v) < np.linalg.norm(u):
        q = round(np.dot(u, v) / np.linalg.norm(v)**2)
        r = u - q * v
        u = v
        v = r
    return u, v

# Example vectors
u = np.array([4, 1])
v = np.array([1, 2])

# Applying the algorithm
reduced_u, reduced_v = lagrange_gauss_reduction(u, v)
print("Reduced Basis: u =", reduced_u, ", v =", reduced_v)
