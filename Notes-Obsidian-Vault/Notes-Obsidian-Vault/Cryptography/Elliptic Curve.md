an **elliptic curve** is a plane curve defined by:
$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$
(a and b must be real numbers on the curve)

This is called the **Weierstrass equation**. The definition of elliptic curve also  requires that the curve is non-singular. (I.e., geometrically speaking.)
- This just means the graph has no cusps, intersections or isolated points

### Point Negation
if 
$$P = (x^P, y^P)
$$
Then:
$P+(x^P,x^P+y^P) = O$
