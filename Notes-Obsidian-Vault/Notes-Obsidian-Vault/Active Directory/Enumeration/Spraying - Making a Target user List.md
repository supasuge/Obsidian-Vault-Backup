## Detailed User Enumeration
To mount a successful password spraying attack, we first need a list of valid domain users to attempt to authenticate with. There are several ways that we can gather a target list of valid users:

- By leveraging an SMB NULL session to retrieve a complete list of domain users from the domain controller
- Utilizing an LDAP anonymous bind to query LDAP anonymously and pull down the domain user list
- Using a tool such as `Kerbrute` to validate users utilizing a word list from a source such as the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo, or gathered by using a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to create a list of potentially valid users
- Using a set of credentials from a Linux or Windows attack system either provided by our client or obtained through another means such as LLMNR/NBT-NS response poisoning using `Responder` or even a successful password spray using a smaller wordlist

It's always important to account for the domain password policy. If we have a SMB NULL session, LDAP anonymous bind, or a set of valid credentials, we can enumerate the password policy. The minimum password length and whether password complexity is enabled will aid the attack.

Knowing the account lockout threshold and bad password timer will tell us how many spray attempts we can do at a time without locking out any accounts and how many minutes we should wait between spray attempts.

Regardless of the method we choose, and if we have the password policy or not, we must always keep a log of our activities, including, but not limited to:

- The accounts targeted
- Domain Controller used in the attack
- Time of the spray
- Date of the spray
- Password(s) attempted


### SMB Null Session to Pull User List
If you are an internal machine but don't have valid domain cred's. You can look for SMB NULL Sessions or LDAP anonymous binds on domain controllers. There will allow you to obtain an accurate list of all users within active directorfy and the password policy. If you already have the cred's for a domain user of a `SYSTEM` access on a Windows host, then you can easily query Active Directory for this information.

It's possible to do this using the SYSTEM account bc it can `impersonate` the computer. A computer obj is treated as a domain user account (with some differences, such as authenticating across forest trusts). If you donâ€™t have a valid domain account, and SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds are not possible, you can create a user list using external resources such as email harvesting and LinkedIn. This user list will not be as complete, but it may be enough to provide you with access to Active Directory.

Some tools that can leverage SMB NULL sessions and LDAP anonymous binds include [enum4linux](https://github.com/portcullislabs/enum4linux), [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html), and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), among others. Regardless of the tool, we'll have to do a bit of filtering to clean up the output and obtain a list of only usernames, one on each line. We can do this with `enum4linux` with the `-U` flag.

#### Using enum4linux
```bash
enum4linux -U MACHINE_IP | grep "user:" | cut -f2 -d"[" | cut -f1 -d"]"

administrator
guest
krbtgt
lab_adm
htb-student
avazquez
pfalcon
fanthony
wdillard
lbradford
sgage
asanchez
dbranch
ccruz
njohnson
mholliday

<SNIP>
```

We can use the `enumdomusers` command after connecting anonymously using `rpcclient`.

#### Using rpcclient

Password Spraying - Making a Target User List

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

rpcclient $> enumdomusers 
user:[administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[lab_adm] rid:[0x3e9]
user:[htb-student] rid:[0x457]
user:[avazquez] rid:[0x458]

<SNIP>
```

Finally, we can use `CrackMapExec` with the `--users` flag. This is a useful tool that will also show the `badpwdcount` (invalid login attempts), so we can remove any accounts from our list that are close to the lockout threshold. It also shows the `baddpwdtime`, which is the date and time of the last bad password attempt, so we can see how close an account is to having its `badpwdcount` reset. In an environment with multiple Domain Controllers, this value is maintained separately on each one. To get an accurate total of the account's bad password attempts, we would have to either query each Domain Controller and use the sum of the values or query the Domain Controller with the PDC Emulator FSMO role.

#### Using CrackMapExec --users Flag

## Gathering Users with LDAP Anonymous

We can use various tools to gather users when we find an LDAP anonymous bind. Some examples include [windapsearch](https://github.com/ropnop/windapsearch) and [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch). If we choose to use `ldapsearch` we will need to specify a valid LDAP search filter. We can learn more about these search filters in the [Active Directory LDAP](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/active-directory-ldap) module.

### Using ldapsearch
```bash
ldapsearch -h MACHINE_IP -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))" | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "
```

Tools like `winapsearch` make this easier, though it's important to understand how to create our own LDAP search filters. We can specify anonymous access by providing a blank username with the `-u` flag and the `-U` flag to tell the tool to retrieve just users.

### Using windapsearch
```bash
./windapsearch.py --dc-ip MACHINE_IP -u "" -U

## Enumerating Users with kerbrute
in the `Initial Enumeration of the Domain` section, if we have4 no access at all from our position in the internal network, we can use `kerbrute` to enumerate valid AD accounts and for password spraying.

This tool uses [Kerberos Pre-Authentication](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Kerberos%20Pre-Authentication), which is a much faster and potentially stealthier way to perform password spraying. This method does not generate Windows event ID [4625: An account failed to log on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625), or a logon failure which is often monitored for.

This tool sends TGT requests to the domain controller without Kerberos Pre-Authentication to perform username enumeration. If the KDC (Key Distribution Center) responds with the error `PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN`, the username is invalid. When the KDC prompts for kerberos Pre-Authentication, this signals that the username exists, and the tool will mark it as valid. This method of username enumeration does not cause logon failures and will not lock out accounts.

However, once we have a list of valid users and switch gears to use this tool for password spraying, failed Kerberos Pre-Authentication attempts will count towards an account's failed login accounts and can lead to account lockout, so we still must be careful regardless of the method chosen.

Let's try out this method using the [jsmith.txt](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames/blob/master/jsmith.txt) wordlist of 48,705 possible common usernames in the format `flast`. The [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo is an excellent resource for this type of attack and contains a variety of different username lists that we can use to enumerate valid usernames using `Kerbrute`.

#### Kerbrute User Enumeration

Using Kerbrute for username enumeration will generate event ID [4768: A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4768). This will only be triggered if [Kerberos event logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-kerberos-event-logging) is enabled via Group Policy. Defenders can tune their SIEM tools to look for an influx of this event ID, which may indicate an attack. If we are successful with this method during a penetration test, this can bean excellent recommendation to add to our report

If we cant create a valid username list, we could turn back to external information gathering and searhc for company email addresses or used a tools such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to mash up possible usernames from a company's LinkedIn page.

## Credentialed Enumeration to Build our User List

With valid credentials, we can use any of the tools stated previously to build a user list. A quick and easy way is using CrackMapExec.

## External Password Spraying

While outside the scope of this module, password spraying is also a common way that attackers use to attempt to gain a foothold on the internet. We have been very successful with this method during penetration tests to gain access to sensitive data through email inboxes or web applications such as externally facing intranet sites. Some common targets include:

- Microsoft 0365
- Outlook Web Exchange
- Exchange Web Access
- Skype for Business
- Lync Server
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Portals
- Citrix portals using AD authentication
- VDI implementations using AD authentication such as VMware Horizon
- VPN portals (Citrix, SonicWall, OpenVPN, Fortinet, etc. that use AD authentication)
- Custom web applications that use AD authentication
