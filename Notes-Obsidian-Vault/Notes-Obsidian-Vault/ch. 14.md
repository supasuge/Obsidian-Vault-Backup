### Script

**[The scene starts with Evan, Adnan, Cal, and Daniel sitting around a table with menus in hand, discussing vacation plans.]**

**Daniel**: So, I was thinking we could start our trip with a beach day. Thoughts?

**Evan** (*interrupting*): Oh, beach is good! But have you seen those mountain cabin deals? They look amazing!

**Daniel** (*trying to regain control of the conversation*): Sure, Evan, but if we could first decide on—

**Evan** (*interrupting again*): And there’s this zip-line tour. We have to do it!

**[Adnan, meanwhile, is scrolling through their phone, only half-listening.]**

**Daniel** (*frustrated but tries again*): Right, but about the beach—

**Evan**: Oh, and what about food? There are these seafood places—

**Daniel** (*visibly frustrated*): Evan, could you let me finish?

**[Adnan chuckles at something on their phone, not engaging in the conversation.]**

**Evan** (*apologetic*): Sorry, sorry, go ahead.

**Daniel**: I just think a beach day would be relaxing to start with. Then maybe we can look into other activities.

**[Adnan suddenly looks up from the phone.]**

**Adnan**: Wait, we’re doing beach stuff? Cool, I’ll bring my new camera!

**Daniel**: Great, but we also need to decide on accommodation and transportation.

**[Adnan’s attention has already drifted back to their phone.]**

**Daniel** (*noticing Adnan’s disinterest*): Adnan, are you even listening?

**Adnan**: Huh? Yeah, yeah, beaches and stuff.

**Daniel** (*sighs and turns to Cal*): Cal, what do you think about renting a car?

**Cal** (*only now paying attention*): Oh, are we talking money stuff now?

**Daniel**: Yes, and it’s important we all pay attention.

**[Cal nods, showing more interest now that the topic has shifted to something they care about.]**

**Daniel**: If we plan well, we can do both the beach and some mountain activities.

**Evan**: That sounds like a plan. Sorry for cutting you off earlier.

**Daniel**: No worries. Let’s make sure we’re all heard. It’s going to be a great trip if we all contribute.

**[The scene ends with them engaging in more productive planning, showing improved listening and respect for each other's ideas.]**

### End of Skit

**Director's Note**: This skit is designed to demonstrate common listening failures within group dynamics and the impact of these on collective decision-making and planning. It wraps up with a positive note on the importance of active listening and mutual respect in collaborative efforts.
