1. **User Processes** - A program/application executed by the user such as Notepad, Google Chrome or Microsoft Word.
    
2. **Subsystem DLLs** - DLLs that contain API functions that are called by user processes. An example of this would be `kernel32.dll` exporting the [CreateFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) Windows API (WinAPI) function, other common subsystem DLLs are `ntdll.dll`, `advapi32.dll`, and `user32.dll`.
    
3. **Ntdll.dll** - A system-wide DLL which is the lowest layer available in user mode. This is a special DLL that creates the transition from user mode to kernel mode. This is often referred to as the Native API or NTAPI.
    
4. **Executive Kernel** - This is what is known as the Windows Kernel and it calls other drivers and modules available within kernel mode to complete tasks. The Windows kernel is partially stored in a file called `ntoskrnl.exe` under "C:\Windows\System32".



### Page Protection Options

Once the pages are committed, they need to have their protection option set. The list of memory protection constants can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/memory-protection-constants) but some examples are listed below.

- `PAGE_NOACCESS` - Disables all access to the committed region of pages. An attempt to read from, write to or execute the committed region will result in an access violation.
    
- `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` - Enables Read, Write and Execute. This is highly discouraged from being used and is generally an IoC because it's uncommon for memory to be both writable and executable at the same time.
    
- `PAGE_READONLY` - Enables read-only access to the committed region of pages. An attempt to write to the committed region results in an access violation.
