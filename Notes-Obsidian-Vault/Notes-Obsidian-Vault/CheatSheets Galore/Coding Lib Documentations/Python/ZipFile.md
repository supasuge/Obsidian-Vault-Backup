Creating a comprehensive and styled Markdown cheatsheet for the Python `zipfile` library is a great idea. I'll cover the main functionalities, provide examples, and format it in a way that's both informative and easy to scan. Since I can't directly access external URLs, I'll base the cheatsheet on my existing knowledge of the `zipfile` library as of April 2023.

# Python `zipfile` Library Cheatsheet

The `zipfile` module in Python is used for reading and writing ZIP files. Here's a concise guide to its main functionalities.

### Reading ZIP Files

**Open a ZIP File**

```python
from zipfile import ZipFile

with ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip:
    # Work with the zip file
```

**Listing Contents**

```python
with ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip:
    print(zip.namelist())
```

### Extracting ZIP Files

**Extract All**

```python
with ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip:
    zip.extractall('extracted_folder')
```

**Extract Single File**

```python
with ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip:
    zip.extract('specific_file.txt', 'extracted_folder')
```

### Creating ZIP Files

**Create a New ZIP File**

```python
with ZipFile('new.zip', 'w') as zip:
    # Add files using zip.write()
```

### Writing to ZIP Files

**Add Files to a ZIP**

```python
with ZipFile('new.zip', 'w') as zip:
    zip.write('file_to_add.txt')
```

**Add Files with a Different Name**

```python
with ZipFile('new.zip', 'w') as zip:
    zip.write('file_to_add.txt', arcname='renamed.txt')
```

### Working with Passwords

**Reading a Password-Protected ZIP**

```python
with ZipFile('protected.zip', 'r') as zip:
    zip.setpassword(b'password')
    # Read files...
```

**Creating a Password-Protected ZIP** *(Note: This feature might be limited to basic ZIP encryption.)*

```python
# As of my last update, the zipfile module doesn't support creating password-protected ZIP files natively.
```

### Context Manager Support

**Using with Context Manager**

```python
with ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip:
    # This ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes
```

### Advanced Features

**ZIP Compression Types**

- `zipfile.ZIP_STORED`: No compression
- `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED`: Standard compression (requires zlib)
- `zipfile.ZIP_BZIP2`: bzip2 compression (requires bz2)
- `zipfile.ZIP_LZMA`: LZMA compression (requires lzma)

**Using Different Compression Methods**

```python
from zipfile import ZIP_DEFLATED

with ZipFile('compressed.zip', 'w', compression=ZIP_DEFLATED) as zip:
    zip.write('file.txt')
```

**Checking ZIP File Validity**

```python
from zipfile import BadZipFile

try:
    with ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as zip:
        # Check if it's a valid zip
        is_valid = zip.testzip()
        if is_valid is None:
            print("Zip file is valid")
        else:
            print(f"First bad file in zip: {is_valid}")
except BadZipFile:
    print("File is not a zip file")
```
