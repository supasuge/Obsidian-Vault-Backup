## Overview

Forensics in CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges involves analyzing digital data to uncover hidden information or evidence of specific activities. Common tasks include file analysis, network traffic analysis, and uncovering hidden data (steganography).

---

## File Analysis

- **File Signature Analysis:**
  - Use tools like `file` in Linux to identify file types.
  - Examine file headers with a hex editor for hidden file types.

- **Metadata Extraction:**
  - `exiftool` for extracting metadata from images, documents, etc.
  - Look for author information, GPS data, software used, etc.

- **File Carving:**
  - Tools like `foremost` or `scalpel` to recover deleted files or hidden data within files.
  - Useful in extracting embedded files or data in disk images.

---

## Network Traffic Analysis

- **Wireshark:**
  - Analyze pcap files for suspicious or anomalous traffic.
  - Filter and follow TCP/UDP streams to reconstruct sessions or find data transfers.

- **NetworkMiner:**
  - Can be used for parsing pcap files and extracting files, certificates, etc.
  - Helps in reconstructing user activities and file transfers.

- **TCPdump:**
  - Command-line tool for network monitoring and data acquisition.
  - Useful for capturing packets on the fly.

---

## Steganography

- **Image Steganography:**
  - Tools like `steghide`, `zsteg`, or online steganography tools to uncover hidden data.
  - Look for anomalies in LSB (Least Significant Bit) or use spectrum analysis.

- **Audio Steganography:**
  - Analyze sound files with tools like `Audacity` for hidden messages.
  - Look for secret messages in spectograms or LSB encoding.

- **Document Steganography:**
  - Analyze text files for hidden messages (acrostics, unusual spaces, etc.).
  - Check for hidden data in document properties or macros.

---

## Cryptography in Forensics

- **Decrypting Encrypted Files:**
  - Use tools like `openssl`, `gpg` for common encryption algorithms.
  - Brute force simple encryptions or find keys hidden in other challenge parts.

- **Hash Analysis:**
  - Identify hash types and attempt cracking with tools like `John the Ripper` or `hashcat`.
  - Look for rainbow tables or known hash collisions.

---

## Memory Forensics

- **Volatility Framework:**
  - Analyze memory dumps for processes, network information, etc.
  - Useful in reconstructing what happened on a system.

- **Rekall Framework:**
  - Advanced memory analysis and incident response tool.
  - Can be used to find hidden processes, analyze malware, etc.

---

## Miscellaneous Tools

- **Binwalk:**
  - For analyzing, extracting, and reverse engineering firmware and binary files.
  
- **Forensic Image Viewer:**
  - Tools like `GIMP` or `IrfanView` to analyze images for hidden data or layers.

- **Strings and grep:**
  - Use `strings` on binary files to extract readable characters, then `grep` for keywords.
