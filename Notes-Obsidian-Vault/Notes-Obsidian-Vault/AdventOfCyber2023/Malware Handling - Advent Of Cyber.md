## Environment Setup Essentials
A *sandbox* is an essential pretend computer setup that acts like a real one. It's a safe place to test malware. A typical setup contains the following features:
- **Network controls**: Sandboxes often have network controls to limit and monitor the network traffic the malware generates. This also prevents the propagation of malware in any other assets.
- **Virtualisation**: Many sandboxes use technologies like VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V to run the malware in a controlled, isolated environment. This allows for easy snapshots, resets, and disposal after the analysis.
- **Monitoring and logging**: Sandboxes record detailed logs of the malware's activities, including system interactions, network traffic, and file modification. These logs are invaluable for analysing and understanding the malware's behaviour.
