SCAN TECHNIQUES:
  -sS/sT/sA/sW/sM: TCP SYN/Connect()/ACK/Window/Maimon scans
  -sU: UDP Scan
  -sN/sF/sX: TCP Null, FIN, and Xmas scans
  --scanflags <flags>: Customize TCP scan flags
  -sI <zombie host[:probeport]>: Idle scan
  -sY/sZ: SCTP INIT/COOKIE-ECHO scans
  -sO: IP protocol scan
  -b <FTP relay host>: FTP bounce scan
```

- If our target sends an `SYN-ACK` flagged packet back to the scanned port, Nmap detects that the port is `open`.
- If the packet receives an `RST` flag, it is an indicator that the port is `closed`.
- If Nmap does not receive a packet back, it will display it as `filtered`. Depending on the firewall configuration, certain packets may be dropped or ignored by the firewall.

Let us take an example of such a scan

When we need to conduct an internal penetration test for the entire network of a company, for example, then we should, first of all, get an overview of which systems are online that we can work with. To actively discover such systems on the network, we can use various `Nmap` host discovery options. There are many options `Nmap` provides to determine whether our target is alive or not. The most effective host discovery method is to use **ICMP echo requests**, which we will look into.

#### Scan Network Range

  Scan Network Range

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.0/24`|Target network range.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA tnet`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.|

This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not. We will take a closer look at these techniques in "`Firewall and IDS Evasion`".

---

## Scan IP List

During an internal penetration test, it is not uncommon for us to be provided with an IP list with the hosts we need to test. `Nmap` also gives us the option of working with lists and reading the hosts from this list instead of manually defining or typing them in.

Such a list could look something like this:

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ cat hosts.lst

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```
If we use the same scanning technique on the predefined list, the command will look like this:

  Scan Network Range

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```







It is always recommended to store every single scan. This can later be used for comparison, documentation, and reporting. After all, different tools may produce different results. Therefore it can be beneficial to distinguish which tool produces which results.

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA tnet`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.|
|`-iL`|Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.lst' list.|


```shell-session
sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18 10.129.2.19 10.129.2.20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```

## Scan Single IP

Before we scan a single host for open ports and its services, we first have to determine if it is alive or not. For this, we can use the same method as before.

  Scan Network Range

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.2.18
Host is up (0.087s latency).
MAC Address: DE:AD:00:00:BE:EF
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.11 seconds
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.18`|Performs defined scans against the target.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA host`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.|

If we disable port scan (`-sn`), Nmap automatically ping scan with `ICMP Echo Requests` (`-PE`). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an `ICMP reply` if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an `ARP ping` resulting in an `ARP reply`. We can confirm this with the "`--packet-trace`" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (`-PE`) for this.

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.18`|Performs defined scans against the target.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA host`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.|
|`-PE`|Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target.|
|`--packet-trace`|Shows all packets sent and received|

Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "`--reason`" option.

  Scan Network Range

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason 
```

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.18`|Performs defined scans against the target.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA host`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.|
|`-PE`|Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target.|
|`--reason`|Displays the reason for specific result.|

We see here that `Nmap` does indeed detect whether the host is alive or not through the `ARP request` and `ARP reply` alone. To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired `ICMP echo requests`, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "`--disable-arp-ping`" option. Then we can scan our target again and look at the packets sent and received.

```shell-session

It is essential to understand how the tool we use works and how it performs and processes the different functions. We will only understand the results if we know what they mean and how they are obtained. Therefore we will take a closer look at and analyze some of the scanning methods. After we have found out that our target is alive, we want to get a more accurate picture of the system. The information we need includes:

- Open ports and its services
- Service versions
- Information that the services provided
- Operating system

There are a total of 6 different states for a scanned port we can obtain:

|**State**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`open`|This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be **TCP connections**, **UDP datagrams** as well as **SCTP associations**.|
|`closed`|When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an `RST` flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.|
|`filtered`|Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.|
|`unfiltered`|This state of a port only occurs during the **TCP-ACK** scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.|
|`open\|filtered`|If we do not get a response for a specific port, `Nmap` will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.|
|`closed\|filtered`|This state only occurs in the **IP ID idle** scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.|

## Discovering Open TCP Ports

By default, `Nmap` scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`). This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, the TCP scan (`-sT`) is performed by default. This means that if we do not define ports and scanning methods, these parameters are set automatically. We can define the ports one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`) from the `Nmap` database that have been signed as most frequent, by scanning all ports (`-p-`) but also by defining a fast port scan, which contains top 100 ports (`-F`).
We see that we only scanned the top 10 TCP ports of our target, and `Nmap` displays their state accordingly. If we trace the packets `Nmap` sends, we will see the `RST` flag on `TCP port 21` that our target sends back to us. 

To have a clear view of the SYN scan, we disable the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`).


Trace the Packets-
`sudo nmap MACHINE IP -p PORT --packet-trace -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping


|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.28`|Scans the specified target.|
|`-p 21`|Scans only the specified port.|
|`--packet-trace`|Shows all packets sent and received.|
|`-n`|Disables DNS resolution.|
|`--disable-arp-ping`|Disables ARP ping.|

We can see from the SENT line that we (`10.10.14.2`) sent a TCP packet with the `SYN` flag (`S`) to our target (`10.129.2.28`). In the next RCVD line, we can see that the target responds with a TCP packet containing the `RST` and `ACK` flags (`RA`). `RST` and `ACK` flags are used to acknowledge receipt of the TCP packet (`ACK`) and to end the TCP session (`RST`).

## Filtered Ports

When a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be `dropped`, or `rejected`. When a packet gets dropped, `Nmap` receives no response from our target, and by default, the retry rate (`--max-retries`) is set to 1. This means `Nmap` will resend the request to the target port to determine if the previous packet was not accidentally mishandled.

Let us look at an example where the firewall `drops` the TCP packets we send for the port scan. Therefore we scan the TCP port **139**, which was already shown as filtered. To be able to track how our sent packets are handled, we deactivate the ICMP echo requests (`-Pn`), DNS resolution (`-n`), and ARP ping scan (`--disable-arp-ping`) again.

## Different Formats

While we run various scans, we should always save the results. We can use these later to examine the differences between the different scanning methods we have used. `Nmap` can save the results in 3 different formats.

- Normal output (`-oN`) with the `.nmap` file extension
- Grepable output (`-oG`) with the `.gnmap` file extension
- XML output (`-oX`) with the `.xml` file extension


## Style sheets

With the XML output, we can easily create HTML reports that are easy to read, even for non-technical people. This is later very useful for documentation, as it presents our results in a detailed and clear way. To convert the stored results from XML format to HTML, we can use the tool `xsltproc`.

  XML Output

```shell-session
gdxqpardo@htb[/htb]$ xsltproc target.xml -o target.html
```

If we now open the HTML file in our browser, we see a clear and structured presentation of our results.

#### Nmap Report

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/19/nmap-report.png)

More information about the output formats can be found at: [https://nmap.org/book/output.html](https://nmap.org/book/output.html)

For us, it is essential to determine the application and its version as accurately as possible. We can use this information to scan for known vulnerabilities and analyze the source code for that version if we find it. An exact version number allows us to search for a more precise exploit that fits the service and the operating system of our target.

---

## Service Version Detection

It is recommended to perform a quick port scan first, which gives us a small overview of the available ports. This causes significantly less traffic, which is advantageous for us because otherwise we can be discovered and blocked by the security mechanisms. We can deal with these first and run a port scan in the background, which shows all open ports (`-p-`). We can use the version scan to scan the specific ports for services and their versions (`-sV`).

A full port scan takes quite a long time. To view the scan status, we can press the `[Space Bar]` during the scan, which will cause `Nmap` to show us the scan status.
