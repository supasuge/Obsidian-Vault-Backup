Base64 encoding can also be handled in python through the use of [The Base64 Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html). This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data. It provides encoding and decoding functions for Base16, Base32, Base64 algorithms, as well as the de-facto standard Ascii85 and Base85 encodings.
