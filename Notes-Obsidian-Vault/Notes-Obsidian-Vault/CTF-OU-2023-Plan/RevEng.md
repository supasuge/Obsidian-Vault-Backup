## Key Concepts in Reverse Engineering

### 1. Understanding Registers in x86_64 Architecture

| Register   | Purpose                                                   | Use Cases                                                    |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| RAX        | Accumulator Register for arithmetic/data manipulation.    | Stores operation results.                                    |
| RBX        | Base Register for data manipulation.                      | Holds memory region base addresses.                          |
| RCX        | Count Register for loop counters and string operations.   | General-purpose, often for loops and strings.                |
| RDX        | Data Register for I/O and arithmetic functions.           | Handles I/O operations, arithmetic.                          |
| RSI        | Source Index for pointer operations.                      | Address of source operand in data transfers.                 |
| RDI        | Destination Index for pointer operations.                 | Address of destination operand in data transfers.            |
| RBP        | Base Pointer for referencing stack frames.                | Points to a specific memory location in the stack frame.     |
| RSP        | Stack Pointer for stack management.                       | Points to the top of the stack.                              |
| RIP        | Instruction Pointer for program flow control.             | Stores the address of the next instruction.                  |
| R8-R15     | Additional General-Purpose Registers for flexibility.     | Provides extra storage and flexibility.                      |
| FLAGS      | Flags Register for status and CPU state.                  | Contains flags like ZF, CF, SF, OF.                          |

### 2. Calling Conventions

#### a. CDECL
- Used in C programs.
- Function arguments are placed on the stack in reverse order.
- Caller cleans up the stack post-function call.

#### b. syscall
- Varies by OS.
- System call numbers and arguments are placed in specific registers.
- Triggers a software interrupt for system function calls.

#### c. System V AMD64 ABI
- Standard for Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS).
- First six integer/pointer arguments in RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9.
- Floating-point arguments in XMM registers.

### 3. Caller-Saved vs. Callee-Saved Registers

| Type             | Responsibility                                              | Details                                                        |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Caller-saved     | Callee may modify these registers.                          | Caller saves/restores these before/after function calls.       |
| Callee-saved     | Callee must preserve the state of these registers.          | Callee saves/restores original values if modified.             |

## Memory Management: Stack vs. Heap

### Stack
- **Functionality**: Manages function call-related data (local variables, return addresses).
- **Structure**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out).
- **Management**: Automatic by the system.
- **Size**: Fixed and determined at compile time or program startup.
- **Usage**: Short-lived, fixed-size data.

### Heap
- **Functionality**: Manages dynamically allocated memory.
- **Allocation**: Explicit management by the programmer (malloc, calloc, free).
- **Size**: Flexible, can grow/shrink during execution.
- **Usage**: Global, dynamically-sized data.
