**Ciphertext** - The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data

**Cipher** - A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.

**Plaintext** - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file

**Encryption** - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.

**Encoding** - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.

**Key** - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.

**Passphrase** - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

**Asymmetric encryption** - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.

**Symmetric encryption** - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt

**Brute force** - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

**Cryptanalysis** - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths

# RSA
Rsa is based on the mathematically difficult problem of working out the factors of a large number. Its very quick to multiply two primse numbers together, say 17*23=301, but its quite difficult to work out what two prime numbers multiply together to make 14351 (113x127)

## Attacking side
The maths behind RSA seems to come up relatively often in CTFs, normally requiring you to calculate variables or break some encryption based on them. The wikipedia page for RSA seems complicated at first, but will give you almost all of the information you need

Some tools for defeating RSA challenges in CTFs:

“p” and “q” are large prime numbers, “n” is the product of p and q.

The public key is n and e, the private key is n and d.


The ~/.ssh folder is the default place to store these keys for OpenSSH. The `authorized_keys` (note the US English spelling) file in this directory holds public keys that are allowed to access the server if key authentication is enabled. By default on many distros, key authentication is enabled as it is more secure than using a password to authenticate. Normally for the root user, only key authentication is enabled.

In order to use a private SSH key, the permissions must be set up correctly otherwise your SSH client will ignore the file with a warning. Only the owner should be able to read or write to the private key (600 or stricter). `ssh -i keyNameGoesHere user@host` is how you specify a key for the standard Linux OpenSSH client.

Using SSH keys to get a better shell~
SSH keys are an excellent way to "Upgrade" a reverse shell, assuming the user has login enabled (www-data normally does not, but regular users and root wiil). Leaving an SSH key in authorized_keys on a box can be a useful backdoor, dont need to deal with any issues of unestablished reverse shells like Control-C or lack of tab completion


[GnuPG or GPG](https://gnupg.org/) is an Open Source implementation of PGP from the GNU project. You may need to use GPG to decrypt files in CTFs. With PGP/GPG, private keys can be protected with passphrases in a similar way to SSH private keys. If the key is passphrase protected, you can attempt to crack this passphrase using John The Ripper and gpg2john. The key provided in this task is not protected with a passphrase.

The man page for GPG can be found online [here](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/de/manual/r1023.html).

### What about AES?

AES, sometimes called Rijndael after its creators, stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. It was a replacement for DES which had short keys and other cryptographic flaws.

AES and DES both operate on blocks of data (a block is a fixed size series of bits).

AES is complicated to explain, and doesn’t seem to come up as often. If you’d like to learn how it works, here’s an excellent video from Computerphile [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xNJsjtN6E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xNJsjtN6E)
