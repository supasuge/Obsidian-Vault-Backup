A vector has a horizontal part and a vertical part, called **components**.

A **vector** describes a shift in space. We can represent it visually with an arrow.


In this case, the vector $v⃗=⟨3,2⟩$ has a horizontal component of $3$ and a vertical component of $2$
- Components can be negative, too.

Vectors that have the same are the **same vector**. `components` are the same vector.

A **component** is a part of a vector. The first component is the horizontal move, and the second component is the vertical move.

For example, the vector ⟨3,−4⟩ has a horizontal component (to the right) of 3, and a vertical component (down) of −4


The order of the components matters — the first component is a horizontal shift, and the second is vertical.

Two vectors are the same only if their horizontal components match and their vertical components match.

A vector can be a shift from anywhere in space, but a point is a specific location.

Since they're different ideas, we use different notation — angle brackets for the vector $⟨3,4⟩$, and curved parentheses for the point $(3,4)$
