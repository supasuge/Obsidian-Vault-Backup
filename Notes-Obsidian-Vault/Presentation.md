##  Listening Process
There are multiple stages to the Listening process, all of which play a crucial role in how we interpret, understand, and respond to verbal and nonverbal communication. The stages of listening include receiving, interpreting, recalling, evaluating, and responding. Each stage is interconnected, building upon the previous to enhance our comprehension and interaction in everyday communication.

The listening process is a complex sequence of steps that begins the moment we are exposed to auditory/visual stimuli and ends with our physical/emotional responses. It’s through this process that we transform these sound waves into meaningful messages paired with visual cues, and aid in our interpretation/comprehension to best form a response for the given situation.


## Stages of Listening
1. Receiving: This is the foundational stage where we use our senses to capture audio and visual cues. It’s about noticing the verbal sounds and nonverbal cues being sent by the communicator.
    
2. Interpreting: At this stage, we process the raw data collected during the receiving stage to make sense of it. This involves understanding the message in the context of our existing knowledge and experiences.
    
3. Recalling: Here, we store the interpreted information in our memory. Our ability to accurately remember this information will affect our ongoing and future interactions with the speaker.
    
4. Evaluating: We critically assess the information, considering it’s validity, relevance, and alignment with our values and beliefs. This stage involves thinking critically about the content and the speaker’s intent.
    
5. Responding: The final stage involves giving feedback to the speaker, which can be verbal or nonverbal depending on the situation.

## Barriers to Effective Listening
  

- Lack of Preparation: Rarely do people receive formal training in listening skills, often perceiving it as less valuable than speaking. Effective listening requires effort and instruction that many overlook, as well as a healthy balance between speaking and listening to properly facilitate effective communication.
    
- Poor Message Quality and Delivery: Messages that are unclear, overly complex, or poorly delivered hinder our ability to listen. Speakers can enhance listening by tailoring messages for ease of processing and avoiding information overload.
    

Lack of Interest: Sometimes, the topic being discussed just isn’t of interest to the individual; and that’s ok! You don’t need to fake it, in fact this can sometimes have a negative effect; however it is still important to remain respectful regardless.


## Impact of Poor Listening Skills
Poor listening skills can severely affect one’s livelihood. Listening is crucial for personal and professional relationships & emotional well-being, however its importance is often taken for granted as direct listening skills aren’t usually taught, and are instead learned over time with experience in everyday situations.

- Poor listening skills can have significant consequences on one’s physical/emotional health, and personal relationships; including at work, with friends/family, in romantic relationships and more.
    

- Frequent listening conflicts can lead to many misunderstandings, and missed opportunities.
    
- Effects not just personal relationships but personal mental health as well
    
- Often enough, poor listening isn’t a deliberate choice; instead it’s a result of distractions, preoccupations, and/or lack of interest/respect. Recognizing this can be the first step towards improvement, as it can be easy to overlook various distractions for a multitude of reasons. 
    
- Leads to poor memory retention and poor communication/comprehension skills in general.
    

In this section, we will review some examples of Poor Listening Skills, some possible causes of these poor habits, and the short/long-term effects on one’s livelihood and personal relationships.


## Examples of Poor Listening
Interrupting Others:

- Example: Alice interrupting Bob whilst Bob is speaking to Alice about something
    
- Short Term: Alice leaves the speaker, Bob feeling disrespected, unheard, and frustrated. Especially so the more emotions are involved with the conversation taking place.
    
- Long Term: Alice develops impatience issues, poor memory retention, lack of ability to control oneself, and lack of meaningful relationships. 
    

  
Selective listening:

- Example: A listener selectively hears only parts of what the speaker says, filtering out information that doesn’t align with their preconceived notions/perception and/or personal opinion on a topic.
    
- Short Term: Misinterpretations and conflict are likely due to heavy bias, and the speaker will be hesitant to share their thoughts in the future due to possible resentment or simply wanting to avoid possible conflict/frustration.
    
- Long Term: Due to frequent misinterpretation and conflict this sort of person is significantly less likely to have frequent genuine conversation’s of value on semi-opinionated topics. This can make it difficult to form long-lasting, meaningful relationships with others. This behavior also leads to significantly affected work performance, as tasks may be incidentally ignored.


## Examples of Poor Listening Pt.2
Pseudo-listening:

- Example: Pretending to listen/seem interested meanwhile you are completely distracted whilst daydreaming, with each word going in one ear out the other without the speaker being aware. Often naturally unintentionally agreeing to whatever is being said regardless of the implications.  
      
    Short Term: Speaker will leave the conversation feeling unheard, unimportant, and disrespected.  
      
    Long Term: Due to the general dishonesty, people are less likely to open up to you in general. This can lead to distant relationships and frequent dishonesty.
    

Ambushing: 

- Example: Listening to a conversation very closely at specific points (with little regard to context, whether present in the situation or not) with the intent of collecting information to then be used against that person/group at a later time.  
      
    Short Term: Highly toxic, rude, and disrespectful. This will lead others to avoid communicating with/around you in order to avoid conflict, and people will feel less comfortable in general around you.  
      
    Long Term: Likely to lead to further dangerous behavior/unhealthy habits and further conflicts/misunderstandings with others.

### Video
## Pseudo-Listening... much?
This video is a solid example of pseudo-listening, the man in the white shirt obnoxiously agrees with everything the man in black having computer issues was saying. Despite him not actually comprehending a single useful piece of information. It seems in this unique case, he was daydreaming about dogs… Which frankly, it’s quite understandable to a degree (I… guess?). How would you have handled this situation if you were the guy obnoxiously agreeing repeatedly, although with a bit less sarcasm? Perhaps you just had more important/interesting things on your mind (including but not limited to: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and College Basketball)? Happens to the best of us, we’re all human (or at least simulated as such) how would you continue this conversation , and how would you have handled things given a similar situation, but with less sarcasm involved? 

Personally, there has been many times I’ve found myself slightly zoning out for whatever reason and blindly acknowledging everything being said with “Yes”, “I hear you”, “dang”, “right”, “uh-huh”, “unfortunate” etc. Only to have to ask for the same details again when a more specific and directed question is asked. It can often be pretty awkward, and some people can get pretty frustrated; especially so if there are lots of emotions involved depending on the context/importance of the situation.
