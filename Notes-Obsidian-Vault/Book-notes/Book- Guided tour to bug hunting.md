#### What is a Debugger?
A debugger normally provides methods to attach to user space processes or the kernel, write and read values to and from registers and memory, and to control program flow using features such as break-points or single-stepping. Each OS is typically shipped with it's own debugger.

**Microsoft Windows** - `WinDbg` 
**Linux/Unix** - `gdb`
