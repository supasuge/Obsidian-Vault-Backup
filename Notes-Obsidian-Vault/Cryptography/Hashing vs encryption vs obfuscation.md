1. **Encoding**: This is a process of converting data into a different format using a publicly known method. It's easily reversible, and no secret key is needed. The purpose is to maintain data usability. Examples include ASCII, Unicode, URL Encoding, and Base64.

2. **Encryption**: This is about keeping data confidential by transforming it so only intended recipients can access it. It requires a secret key for both encrypting and decrypting the data. Encryption is used to ensure that data remains private and secure. Examples are AES, Blowfish, and RSA.

3. **Hashing**: This method is used for verifying data integrity. It converts input into a fixed-length string, which changes drastically with any alteration of the input. It's a one-way process, meaning you can't derive the original input from the output. This is crucial for secure authentication and detecting data tampering. Examples include SHA-3 and the now obsolete MD5.

4. **Obfuscation**: The goal of obfuscation is to make something, like code, difficult to understand. It's more about creating a hurdle rather than a secure barrier. It can be reversed or manually worked through. Obfuscation is not as strong as encryption but is useful for protecting things like intellectual property in software. Examples are JavaScript Obfuscator and ProGuard.

5. **Summary**:
   - **Encoding**: Retains usability, reversible, no key.
   - **Encryption**: Protects confidentiality, requires a key, reversible with the key.
   - **Hashing**: Ensures integrity, one-way process, detects data changes.
   - **Obfuscation**: Makes understanding difficult, used to protect code from easy replication.

**Note**: Obfuscation is chosen over encryption when the goal is to make data harder for certain entities (like humans) to understand while still being processable by others (like computers). Encryption, on the other hand, renders data unreadable to both without the key.
