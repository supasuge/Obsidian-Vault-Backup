User space logging involves capturing and analysing log messages generated by applications, services, and user activities. The syslog is a standard for message logging on Linux systems, facilitating the centralised collection and management of log messages from various sources. 

## Overview
Syslog has evolved over time, with different daemon versions being used:

1. **syslogd:** The original daemon with basic logging capabilities.
2. **syslog-ng:** An enhanced version that provided more features such as content-based filtering, TCP transport, and complex configuration options.
3. **rsyslog:** The most recent syslog daemon with high performance, modularity and support for TLS encryption, database storage, and message modification.
