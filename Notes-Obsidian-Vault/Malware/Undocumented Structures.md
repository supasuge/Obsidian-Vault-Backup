### PEB Structure Example

As mentioned in an earlier module, the Process Environment Block or PEB is a data structure that holds information about a Windows process. However, [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/ns-winternl-peb) on the PEB structure shows several reserved members. This makes it difficult to access the members of the structure.

```c
typedef struct _PEB {
  BYTE                          Reserved1[2];
  BYTE                          BeingDebugged;
  BYTE                          Reserved2[1];
  PVOID                         Reserved3[2];
  PPEB_LDR_DATA                 Ldr;
  PRTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS  ProcessParameters;
  PVOID                         Reserved4[3];
  PVOID                         AtlThunkSListPtr;
  PVOID                         Reserved5;
  ULONG                         Reserved6;
  PVOID                         Reserved7;
  ULONG                         Reserved8;
  ULONG                         AtlThunkSListPtr32;
  PVOID                         Reserved9[45];
  BYTE                          Reserved10[96];
  PPS_POST_PROCESS_INIT_ROUTINE PostProcessInitRoutine;
  BYTE                          Reserved11[128];
  PVOID                         Reserved12[1];
  ULONG                         SessionId;
} PEB, *PPEB;
```

### Alternative Documentation

As previously mentioned, some modules will avoid using Microsoft's documentation and instead use other documentation sources.

- [Process Hacker's Header Files](https://github.com/winsiderss/systeminformer/tree/master/phnt/include)
    
- [undocumented.ntinternals.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20230401045934/http://undocumented.ntinternals.net/) - Some structures may be outdated
    
- [ReactOS's Documentation](https://doxygen.reactos.org/globals_type.html)
    
- [Vergilius Project](https://www.vergiliusproject.com/) - Although mainly for Windows kernel structures, it remains a valuable resource.
