The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data, or destruction of data.

- **Disclosure** is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- **Alteration** is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
- **Destruction/Denial** is the opposite of Availability.

The opposite of the CIA Tria would be the DAD Triad: Disclosure, Alteration and Destruction

### Bell-LaPadula Model

The Bell-LaPadula Model aims to achieve **confidentiality** by specifying three rules:

- **Simple Security Property**: This property is referred to as “no read up”; it states that a subject at a lower security level cannot read an object at a higher security level. This rule prevents access to sensitive information above the authorized level.
- **Star Security Property**: This property is referred to as “no write down”; it states that a subject at a higher security level cannot write to an object at a lower security level. This rule prevents the disclosure of sensitive information to a subject of lower security level.
- **Discretionary-Security Property**: This property uses an access matrix to allow read and write operations. An example access matrix is shown in the table below and used in conjunction with the first two properties.

|Subjects|Object A|Object B|
|---|---|---|
|Subject 1|Write|No access|
|Subject 2|Read/Write|Read|
