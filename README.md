# Obsidian-Vault-Backup
Backup archive of my Obsidian notes that I have collected over the last 1 - 1.5 years give or take.

It's quite messy and all over the place... it make's sense to me and that's all that matters. Feel free to use anything that could be useful to you as well. 


**Updates coming soon!**
